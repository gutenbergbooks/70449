<h2 id='chI'>CHAPTER I: UP AGAINST IT</h2>

<p>Fog and rain, with the spluttering arclights shining
like moons out of the drizzle and a mist; the rattle
of wheels on cobbles, soughing of fog-horns down
on San Francisco Bay; the far-off din of a cable
car gong, and always the dismal patter of rain
along the gutter.</p>

<p>A girl stopped at the entrance of a cheap boarding
house, where a single electric bulb partly illuminated
the faded sign. Her faded old raincoat glistened in
the light, and her cheap felt hat leaked drops of
water as she glanced up at the sign.</p>

<p>It was not because she was unfamiliar with that
sign. Nan Whitlock had passed under it several
times a day for a number of months, because it
was her home. That is, it was the only home she
had, and just now she was wondering how much
longer she could call it home.</p>

<p>After a short period of reflection she went inside,
passed the dining-room door and started up the
stairs. Beneath the raincoat was a small parcel,
and she quickly slipped it farther out of sight as
a step sounded on the stairs above her.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Emmett, the landlady, a short,
chubby sort of woman, but with features prematurely
hardened from forcing payments. Just now
she narrowed her eyes and glanced upon Nan
Whitlock as she partly blocked the stairs.</p>

<p>“I was just at your room, Miss Whitlock,” she
said. “Unless you and Miss Allan pay for that
room before breakfast to-morrow, I’ve a new
inhabitant for the same.”</p>

<p>“Was—was Miss Allan there?” faltered Nan.</p>

<p>“She was not. I’m tired of promises, and I just
heard that Miss Allan’s show closes to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” said Nan meekly.</p>

<p>“Oh, ye do? And I suppose I was to be left
holding the sack, as they say, eh? Well, I’m not.
I’ve had her trunk put in storage to-day, and she’ll
not get it until the rent is all paid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry about that, Mrs. Emmett.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be sorry, too, I’m thinking. Oh, I don’t
mean to be cross about it, but business is business.
If I have to, I’ll attach your wages, my dear. With
a fly-by-night like Madge Allan, all I can do is take
her trunk. You tell her, will ye? And, of course,
that means both of ye get out, unless the money is
paid. Her with her fine clothes and fur coats, and
a taxi at the door almost every night! And she
can’t pay twenty dollars rent! Well, you two
think it over, my dear. Unless I miss my guess,
I’ll have a vacancy after breakfast.”</p>

<p>She stepped aside and walked grandly down the
stairs, while Nan hurried on to her room, where she
lighted the gas jets, threw off her wet coat and
sat down rather heavily. Nan was not pretty, but
she had an oval face, wistful gray eyes, and a
wealth of wavy auburn hair. Twenty-two her last
birthday, and out of a job again.</p>

<p>“Attach my wages,” she said, half aloud. “Fine
chance. With it all in my pocket.”</p>

<p>The steam in the radiators clanked furiously for
a moment. Nan got to her feet, took a pair of old
slippers from under the bed and removed her wet
shoes.</p>

<p>Then from a locked drawer in the dresser she
took a gas plate, with a long hose, which she attached
to one of the gas jets. From the parcel she had
carried she produced hamburger steak. From
another locked drawer she took a frying-pan, a
small coffee-pot, and a box which contained bread,
butter, eggs and coffee.</p>

<p>On the wall was a printed warning that the
management positively did not allow cooking in
the rooms. Nan hung her wet hat over the top of
it and proceeded with her cooking. The room was
full of the savoury odours when Madge Allan came
in. She slammed the door quickly behind her and
grinned at Nan.</p>

<p>Madge Allan was a different type than Nan
Whitlock. Madge was a tall, willowy blonde,
affecting much rouge, flashily dressed. Just now
her face was streaked with rain, and her Hudson
seal coat looked rather bedraggled.</p>

<p>“Well, I dodged her,” she said triumphantly.
“Stood out there in the rain until the noblest
Roman of them all went to the kitchen to take a
fall out of the cook for using too much shortening
in the pie crust, and then I took them stairs four
at a time. Hamburger and onions! My Gawd,
honey, don’t you ever lose your appetite for dainties
like that?”</p>

<p>Nan shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“No dodging it now,” she said rather bitterly.
“Lost my job to-day. Cutting down the force, they
said. They’ll pay a dividend on what they’ll save
on my salary, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Aw, gee, that’s tough!” Madge flapped her
hands dismally against her wet coat. “Canned in
the winter, like a—a—what do they can in the
winter, Nan? Pshaw, that’s too bad. And my
show closes to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>She came over closer to Nan and put a hand on
her shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, kid, I like you a lot, because
you never ask questions. One of these days I’m
going to fall into some money, and when I do,
we’ll—well, you wait. Oh, it won’t be long. Nope,
I don’t crave hamburger. Jack Pollock is taking
me out to the Cliff House for dinner to-night if I
can get out of here without giving up my coat to
the landlady.”</p>

<p>“She’s taken your trunk, Madge.”</p>

<p>“My trunk!” Madge whirled around and looked
at the corner of the room, where her trunk had
been. Her lips tightened and her eyes flashed with
anger.</p>

<p>“She told me about it on the stairs,” said Nan
slowly. “I haven’t even a trunk for her to take;
so she’ll probably put me in jail.”</p>

<p>Madge shook her head quickly.</p>

<p>“No, she won’t. I’ll make Jack give me enough
to pay up the rent. He’s a good scout, and he’s
got plenty. Anyway, he can advance me that much
and he’s gambler enough to take a chance.”</p>

<p>“Advance you that much?” queried Nan.
“Are you going to work for Jack Pollock, Madge?”</p>

<p>“Not the way you think. I’d be a poor stick
in his gambling house. No, it’s just a private deal,
kid. Well, I’ve got to meet Jack right away, and
as long as Mrs. Julius Cæsar has the trunk, I won’t
mind if she does meet me now. But it might not
be so good for her. Now, don’t worry, kid. This is
just one evening, and to-morrow is another day.
Forget the job and enjoy the hamburger. Lock
the door behind me, because if that old battle-axe
ever gets a whiff of that aroma, she’ll send for the
fire department.”</p>

<p>Nan laughed and locked the door behind her.
She was fond of the breezy Madge, and Madge was
fond of her. They had met several months before,
when both of them were looking for a rooming
house.</p>

<p>Nan was an orphan, raised by an aunt in Portland,
Oregon, who died leaving nothing but debts, but
luckily she had lived long enough to give Nan a
good home and to educate her. Nan had tried
clerking, but the wages were too small, and her last
venture had been as a stenographer in a broker’s
office. Now this position had vanished, and all the
money she owned was in her pocket-book, and that
hardly sufficient to square up her room rent.</p>

<p>As she ate her home-cooked meal she wondered
what Madge had meant about falling into money.
In discussing their affairs, Madge had said that she
didn’t have a relative who wasn’t poorer than the
proverbial church mouse.</p>

<p>Nan did not care for the sleek Jack Pollock, a
gambler, although he had always seemed decent
enough.</p>

<p>She washed her dishes and put everything away
neatly. There was still an aroma of cooked foods
when the landlady knocked softly on the door.</p>

<p>“I have a letter here for Madge Allan,” she said,
when Nan cautiously opened the door a few inches.
“She said something about getting money from
home, and this letter might just be the one she’ll
be looking for.”</p>

<p>The last was rather sarcastic as she handed the
letter to Nan, sniffing at the hamburger-tainted
atmosphere.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” she said. “I’d almost swear
that ain’t no odour from my kitchen.”</p>

<p>“I really can’t smell anything,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got a fine cold, young lady. Somebody
in this house has been cooking hamburger and
onions.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that is rather astonishing?”</p>

<p>“Astonishing! If I find out who it is I’ll astonish
them. I run a boarding house, I’d have you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you do, Mrs. Emmett. Good
evening.”</p>

<p>Nan closed the door and tossed the letter to the
table, listening to Mrs. Emmett going down the
creaking stairs. Nan was tired of Mrs. Emmett,
tired of the eternal grind of trying to make enough
money to keep body and soul together.</p>

<p>But to-morrow she must go in search of another
position, and possibly in search of another place to
live, unless Madge was fortunate enough to raise
the price of their delinquent rent. Nan had little to
move. One valise carried her worldly goods.</p>

<p>It was about eleven o’clock that night, and Nan
was fast asleep when Mrs. Emmett knocked loudly
on the door.</p>

<p>“There’s a telephone call, Miss Whitlock! The
man said it was very important.”</p>

<p>Nan crawled out of bed and wrapped herself in
one of Madge’s dressing robes, wondering what man
could have any important conversation with her at
eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>She pattered down the stairs to the telephone,
while Mrs. Emmett stood within earshot.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Whitlock,” said Nan sleepily.</p>

<p>“Emergency Hospital, Miss Whitlock,” said a
heavy, masculine voice. “You are Madge Allan’s
room-mate?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nan weakly.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Miss Allan’s relatives
live?”</p>

<p>“Why—no,” faltered Nan. “What is the
matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” said the man slowly. “Miss
Allan was killed an hour ago in an accident. A
Mr. Pollock was badly injured, but was able to
give us your name. He said⸺”</p>

<p>“You say she was killed?”</p>

<p>“Instantly. We would like to get in touch with
some of her relatives. Mr. Pollock didn’t know⸺”</p>

<p>Nan sagged away from the telephone, sick at
heart.</p>

<p>“Who got killed?” interrupted Mrs. Emmett.</p>

<p>Nan braced up and turned back to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Why, I—I don’t know where any of them
live,” she said wearily. “Somewhere in the East,
I think. She spoke of a cousin somewhere in
Arizona, but I don’t remember the place.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, thanks, just the same, Miss Whitlock.”</p>

<p>The receiver clicked back into place and Nan
turned from the phone.</p>

<p>“Miss Allan was killed in a wreck, Mrs. Emmett,”
said Nan. “She is at the Emergency Hospital.”</p>

<p>“Well, can ye imagine that now? And her all
alive and well a few hours ago. And me threatenin’
to turn her out in the morning. Dear, dear!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Emmett walked away, shaking her head.
Near the telephone was an old rocking-chair, and
Nan sank down in it weakly. The one person in the
whole world who had been a real friend to her had
been snuffed out like a candle in the wind. Nan
didn’t know what to do. She knew there was no
use of her going to the hospital, at least, not that
night.</p>

<p>It was draughty there in the hall, so she stumbled
back up the stairs, and sat down in her room, her
knees weak from the shock. The rain whipped dismally
against the windows, coming in from the bay,
where the fog-horns bellowed unceasingly. She had
propped Madge’s letter against a book on the table,
and now she picked it up. It was postmarked Lobo
Wells, Arizona.</p>

<p>Perhaps this letter would give a clue to Madge’s
relatives, she mused. With no thought of anything
but a desire to help in the matter, she opened the
envelope and drew out the enclosure. It was a
typewritten letter, and pinned to it was a cheque
for one hundred dollars, made out to Madge Singer.</p>

<p>Nan looked it over curiously. It was drawn on
the Bank of Lobo Wells, and signed with an inky
scrawl, which she finally deciphered. The letter
read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='ni'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Miss Singer</span>,—Your
uncle, Jim Singer,
has passed away, and his last will and testament,
executed by me, shows you to be his sole heir. Am
enclosing certified cheque for one hundred dollars
for your expenses, as I expect you to come here at
once.</p>

<p>“As I understand it, you have never known your
uncle personally, and have never been in Lobo
Wells. Come direct here, go to the hotel and get in
communication with me at once.</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:4em;'>“Very truly yours,</div>
<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:3em;'>“<span class='sc'>Amos A. Baggs</span>,</div>
<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:2em;'>“Attorney at Law.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Nan stared at the letter, trying to understand
what it meant. Finally she realised that possibly
Madge had taken the name of Allan as a theatrical
<i>nom de plume</i>, and that her family name was Singer.
Perhaps, thought Nan, this inheritance was the
money Madge had spoken of “falling into soon.”
Madge had mentioned some relative in Arizona,
and Nan thought she had mentioned a cousin; but
it might have been an uncle.</p>

<p>Nan fingered the hundred-dollar cheque. It was
more money than she had possessed in over a year.
It was certified. Any one signing Madge Singer’s
name to it could draw the money. And Madge
Singer was dead. Nan shut her hand tightly over
the cheque.</p>

<p>“There is no Madge Singer,” she told herself.
“Only Lobo Wells, Arizona, knows that there ever
was a Madge Singer. Why not cash the cheque?”</p>

<p>Nan was not a crook, but adversity caused her
to grasp at straws. She needed clothes. This cheque
would solve that problem. It would pay her room
rent, give her a chance. She stared at the rain-washed
window and at the four walls of the shabby
room. Madge Allan’s rather hard, mocking laughter
seemed still to echo from those walls. She had often
laughed at Nan and told her to go ahead and gamble
with life.</p>

<p>“Bluff them, kid,” she had often advised. “You
don’t need to be bad to bluff. Life is a gamble
and a fight; but the fight is a lot easier if you
bluff the gamblers. Take all you can get.”</p>

<p>That was Madge Allan’s philosophy of life, take
a chance.</p>

<p>“Madge would do it,” Nan told herself as she
hugged the old robe around her white throat to
keep out the chill.</p>

<p>She read the letter again, a tight feeling in her
throat.</p>

<p>“⸺have never been in Lobo Wells—have
never known your uncle personally.”</p>

<p>She dropped the letter in her lap. Who would
know? Nobody in Lobo Wells. Something was
telling her to take a chance. It hammered in her
ears above the moaning of the fog-horns.</p>

<p><i>Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance.</i></p>

<p>It was like the clicking of car wheels on a railroad
track. Ahead of her was the hard, dreary round of
job-seeking, the pitifully few dollars in her pocket,
no place to call home.</p>

<p>She carefully folded up the letter and cheque,
put them in her purse. She felt weak and foolish
over it all. Her face was white in the cheap mirror
over the dresser.</p>

<p>“If they throw you in jail you won’t have to
pay rent,” she told herself. “They don’t have
landladies in jails—not to make collections. Anyway,
I wouldn’t be stealing from live people. Her
uncle is dead and Madge is dead. A dead woman’s
shoes!”</p>

<p>Nan crept back into bed after turning off the
gas jet. She forgot that on the morrow she would
be minus a bed. The horrors of job-hunting were
also forgotten. She was wondering whether a
medium-sized, red-headed girl could substitute for
a tall, willowy blonde in Arizona.</p>

<h2 id='chII'>CHAPTER II: LEN AYRES RETURNS</h2>

<p>“I tell yuh, nothin’ never happens around here,”
declared Johnny Harris. “Gimme three cards,
mostly aces.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” said Smoky Ash seriously, “yo’re
goin’ to fill one of them two-card flushes yo’re
always drawin’ to, Johnny. How many do you
desire, Harry?”</p>

<p>Harry Cole, owner of the Oasis Saloon and
Gambling House, indicated that he wasn’t drawing
any cards.</p>

<p>“Out on a limb, eh?” grinned Johnny. “Some
day I’m goin’ to saw that limb off between you and
yore bank roll.”</p>

<p>He peeked carefully at the cards he had drawn,
spat disgustedly and shoved the cards aside.</p>

<p>“Just like I said,” he declared plaintively,
“nothin’ ever happens in Lobo Wells. Punch cows
twenty-nine days in the month for enough to have
a few drinks and try to make two danged deuces
beat a pat hand.”</p>

<p>Johnny Harris was lean, lank, with a long nose,
sad eyes and stringy hair. He had been voicing
the same complaint as far back as any of them could
remember, but he stayed on at the JP ranch in
spite of all the drawbacks.</p>

<p>Harry Cole was an ex-sheriff of Lobo Wells, a
man about forty years of age; a big man physically,
swarthy of complexion, with black hair and a small
moustache. Just now business was dull, and he
was playing draw poker with a few of the cowboys,
who had finished loading a train of cattle.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ never happens nowhere as fur as that
goes,” said Smoky Ash, who also worked for the
JP outfit. “Yuh can read about things happenin’
in the newspapers, but they don’t. I’ve heard that
them newspaper fellers are bigger liars than cowboys.
That’s prob’ly exaggerated, but—I’ll pass it
to a pat hand, Harry. Make yore bluff, feller.”</p>

<p>Cole smiled and made a sizable bet, but there
was no opposition, so he yawned and raked in the
pot.</p>

<p>“Didja ever try sleepin’ for that?” asked
Johnny. “Yuh might dislocate yore jaw and
then⸺”</p>

<p>Johnny had glanced toward the door, where a
man was coming in, and he did not finish the sentence.
The newcomer was of medium height, dressed
in an old suit of store clothes, with an old felt hat
on his head, disclosing a tinge of gray hair at his
temples.</p>

<p>His face was rather long, deeply lined, and his
greenish-gray eyes were as hard as agates. He came
slowly, unblinking.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, if it ain’t Len Ayres!” blurted
Johnny. “Len, you old son-of-a-sea-cook!”</p>

<p>Harry Cole jerked around so quickly that his
elbow swept some of his stacked chips to the floor
as Johnny kicked back his chair and arose to greet
Len Ayres. Smoky got to his feet, a grin on his
lips, waiting for a chance to shake hands with the
man who did not smile.</p>

<p>“By golly, it’s good to see yuh ag’in, Len,”
declared Johnny.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s kinda good to be back, Johnny.
Hello, Smoky. Still the same as ever, eh? Hello,
Sam,” he nodded to Sam Lytel, of the OK outfit,
and turned to Harry Cole.</p>

<p>“Changed yore occupation, eh?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Len,” said Harry hoarsely. “Yes, I’ve
changed. Went out of office two years ago, you
know.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know it. A fellow don’t hear much
about the outside world where I’ve been for the last
five years.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good to see yuh back, Len,” declared
Johnny, “and I’ll buy a drink.”</p>

<p>“Thank yuh, but I’m not drinkin’, Johnny.
Found out I didn’t need it, yuh see.” He turned
to Cole. “Who took yore job?”</p>

<p>“Ben Dillon.”</p>

<p>“Bennie Dillon, eh?”</p>

<p>“And he hired ‘Breezy’ Hill for a deputy,”
added Johnny.</p>

<p>A semblance of a smile flashed across Len’s hard
mouth.</p>

<p>“Breezy Hill? About as much fitted to be a
deputy as I would be to be Governor of the State.
He still drinkin’?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t never slacked up none,” grinned
Smoky.</p>

<p>Johnny Harris cashed in his few chips, and a few
minutes later he and Len Ayres walked outside and
sat down together on the edge of the wooden sidewalk.</p>

<p>“How much do yuh know of the things that
happened after yuh left, Len?” asked Johnny.</p>

<p>Len’s lips tightened perceptibly.</p>

<p>“Harmony wrote me two or three letters,” he
said slowly.</p>

<p>Jim Singer—“Harmony” Singer he was always
called—had been Len’s best friend, and owned the
Box S outfit.</p>

<p>“He told yuh about yo’re—yo’re wife, Len?”</p>

<p>Len turned his head away, nodding quickly.</p>

<p>“Yeah, he told me, Johnny. She got her divorce
right away and married Charley Prentice.”</p>

<p>“But that ain’t all, Len.”</p>

<p>“I know—she died. Harmony wrote me about
it.”</p>

<p>“Charley’s still got the kid, Len.”</p>

<p>“He’s seven now,” said Len slowly. “Do yuh
ever see him?”</p>

<p>“Every little while, Len. They call him Larry
Prentice. Yuh see, he wouldn’t remember yuh,
Len.”</p>

<p>Len shook his head, but his eyes were soft now.</p>

<p>“I know it, Johnny. He was such a little feller
when I went away. That was the hellish part of
it—leavin’ the kid. Oh, I wasn’t fooled in my wife,
Johnny. But that kid—he didn’t know better than
to like me. He was my kid!” Len’s voice was
savage. “I used to talk to myself about him at
first—I mean until I got that last letter from
Harmony—the one about Della marryin’ Charley.
He wrote me one after that, about her dyin’.”</p>

<p>“You heard about Harmony Singer, didn’t yuh,
Len?”</p>

<p>Len stared at Johnny for several moments.</p>

<p>“Heard about <i>him</i>? What do yuh mean?”</p>

<p>“O-oh,” breathed Johnny softly. “You didn’t
hear about him gettin’ killed?”</p>

<p>“About him gettin’ killed? Harmony Singer?”</p>

<p>Johnny nodded sadly.</p>

<p>“Yeah, about a week ago, Len. Horse dragged
him to death. They buried him in the old cemetery.
I thought you’d heard.”</p>

<p>Len shut his eyes tightly, his lips quivering
slightly. For possibly a minute neither of them
spoke. Then—</p>

<p>“He was my friend,” said Len.</p>

<p>“I know it, Len. Old Whisperin’ and Sailor are
still out there at the ranch. It was a shock to them.
They’re gettin’ old, don’tcha know it?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s right. But old Harmony. You
say a horse dragged him to death, Johnny?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Harmony was in town here and he
had a lotta drinks. You know how he could drink,
Len. Well, he wasn’t ridin’ a particularly bad
bronc, but I s’pose he—well, anyway, the horse
drug him home. He was shore in a awful shape.
Whisperin’ Taylor found him. Queer old coot,
Whisperin’ is. It hurt him a lot—him and Sailor
Jones.”</p>

<p>“It hurts me too,” said Len softly. “I liked
Harmony.”</p>

<p>“He was a square shooter, Len.”</p>

<p>“My best friend. Nothin’ could make him believe
the things they said about me.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>A man was going down the opposite side of the
street, and Len looked across at him, squinting his
eyes sharply.</p>

<p>“Amos Baggs, eh?” he said bitterly. “Still
here.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he’s still here, Len. But he ain’t prosecutor
no more. Still runnin’ a law office. Nick
Collins beat him bad at the election after you left.
I reckon Amos is still sour over that election.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t changed much,” Len said slowly.</p>

<p>“His kind don’t change, Len. He shore can say
mean things in a court room.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it,” bitterly. “You don’t know
how I wished for a six-shooter then, Johnny. I
wanted to fill his whole body with lead. Mebbe I
still want to. But if I ever do anythin’ they could
send me back there for, they’ll never take me alive.
I know what that place is now. You probably
wonder why I came back, Johnny. Sometimes I
wonder too. Lack of brains, mebbe. No sane man
would ever come back here, after what happened
to me. But I paid the penalty, didn’t I? And my
kid is here,” he added softly. “My kid, Johnny.
Oughtn’t that bring a man back?”</p>

<p>“Shore,” said Johnny thoughtfully. He thought
he knew why Len Ayres came back. Perhaps the
kid had something to do with it, but it was the
money that had brought him back.</p>

<p>Nothing had been proved, except that Len had
robbed the Lobo Wells bank and half-killed the
cashier. They found Len’s hat there on the floor,
where it fell off in his getaway. That hold-up only
netted him seven thousand, but there were others,
a lone-handed train robbery, which netted the
bandit about ten thousand dollars, a stage robbery
of five thousand dollars. Of course, they were
unable to fix the blame for all of these on
Len, but his description fitted that of the
bandit.</p>

<p>Len had had no chance to spend any of the
money; so the people of Manzanita Valley knew he
had cached it, and that he would come back and
get it when his five years were up. Len’s wife had
married the cashier of the bank, where Len had left
his hat, but she had died from pneumonia a short
time later.</p>

<p>Len had managed to beat his way back from
the penitentiary and was in Lobo Wells without a
cent in his pocket. The town was not changed; the
same people were there, except those who had died
off.</p>

<p>“Well,” Len said finally, “I reckon I’ll go out
to the Box S, Johnny.”</p>

<p>“How are yuh goin’, Len?”</p>

<p>“Walk, I reckon. Ain’t been on a horse for a
long time.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t scared to ride, are yuh?” smiled Johnny.
Len had been one of their best riders.</p>

<p>“No-o, I ain’t scared.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get yuh a bronc at the livery stable, Len.
Never mind about the money. You’d do it for me.
C’mon.”</p>

<p>Johnny secured a horse and saddle at the stable,
and Len climbed into a saddle for the first time in
five years. The stable keeper was a man who had
come to Lobo Wells after Len had been sent to the
penitentiary, but he had heard men tell of Len
Ayres, the single-handed bandit.</p>

<p>“So that’s Len Ayres, eh?” he said to Johnny.
“Well, he don’t look so mean.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t mean,” replied Johnny quickly.
“There ain’t a mean bone in his body.”</p>

<p>“Jist looks kinda sour, thasall.”</p>

<p>“You go through what he’s gone through, and
you’ll shore look sour. Charge that horse up to me,
and I’ll pay yuh on the first of next month.”</p>

<p>“Sure, thasall right, Harris. Didn’t the cashier
of the bank marry Ayres’s wife after he was sent
up?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but she died.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I heard. That little boy belongs
to him, they say. Nice lookin’ kid, too. I wonder if
there’s any truth in this talk about Ayres makin’ a
cache of all that money he stole.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that ache yuh,” said Johnny seriously.
“He paid what the law asked, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He paid for the bank robbery.”</p>

<p>Johnny yawned heavily.</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah, that’s right. I reckon he’ll get along.”</p>

<p>Len rode out to the Box S, located about three
miles south-east of Lobo Wells. As far as any
change in the country was concerned, Len might
have been away only a week. There were the same
old chuckholes in the road, which had never been
repaired. The cattle along the road looked the
same. He saw an old spotted steer, with extra long
horns, which he was sure was the one which had
driven him to the top of the corral fence one day.</p>

<p>He halted on the edge of a small mesa and looked
down at the huddle of unpainted buildings which
constituted the Box S ranch. Nothing had been
changed in five years. For a long time he sat there,
lost in memories. Off to the westward he could
see the smoke of a train heading for Lobo Wells.
Beyond that was the green ribbon, which marked
the twisting of Manzanita River, now only a small
stream. Far to the south was the blue haze of the
lower valley, and to the north and the east stretched
the Broken Hills, piled-up mesa and broken cañon,
fantastically coloured in the changing lights.</p>

<p>Finally he rode on down to the ranch, where he
dismounted at the old front porch, tied his horse
and halted at the bottom step.</p>

<p>“That jist makes seventy-seven times I’ve done
told yuh that I don’t know, Sailor,” declared a
querulous voice. “Why don’tcha ever go out and
cut wood, ’stead of settin’ in there and askin’
questions? How in hell do I know what’s to become
of this here rancheria?”</p>

<p>“Don’t chide me, you ol’ weepin’-willer,” retorted
the voice of Sailor Jones, so named because he got
drunk one day and sent to a mail-order house for a
rowboat.</p>

<p>“You make me bilious,” said Whispering Taylor.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’ll betcha! It’s yore cookin’ that makes
yuh bilious. I’m goin’ to quit yuh, before I git
dyspepsy. Anyway, there ain’t no future for a
feller around here no more.”</p>

<p>“Future!”</p>

<p>“Yea, future. I’m three year younger than you
are, ain’t I? By the time I’m yore age⸺”</p>

<p>“You’d be older, if yuh didn’t lie.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sixty yet.”</p>

<p>“Not yet—yo’re past it, feller. Why didn’tcha
stop arguin’ and use up some of yore youthful wim
and wigger on the woodpile? I shore hate to argue
with a child. Go set on the corral fence and repeat
yore ABC’s, while a man mixes up some biscuits in
peace, will yuh?”</p>

<p>“Put some sody in ’em this time, Whisperin’,
will yuh? You allus leaves out somethin’, and I’d
rather have anythin’ left out rather than sody.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe you’d like to make’ em, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t, Whisperin’. I’ll get yuh some
wood, if yuh crave it real hard. But I’d shore like
to know what’s to become of this here rancho, since
Harmony died.”</p>

<p>“That makes seventy-eight times,” groaned
Whisperin’.</p>

<p>“I never asked yuh, you bat-eared pelican! I
said I’d like to know, thasall. You couldn’t tell me.”</p>

<p>Len smiled softly. He had known these two men
for years, and they had always argued like this.
Came sound of a squeaking boot, and Sailor Jones
came out on the porch.</p>

<p>He stopped short, staring at Len. Sailor was a
little, wizened person, with high cheek-bones,
crooked nose, deep-set blue eyes and a wide, thin-lipped
mouth. His slightly gray hair was thin,
and stood up on his head like fox-tail tops.</p>

<p>He blinked rapidly, rubbed the palm of his right
hand violently on his thigh, as he cleared his throat,
which action caused his prominent Adam’s apple
to jiggle nervously.</p>

<p>“By Gawd!” he said softly. “If it is, I’m glad,
and if it ain’t, I swear that me and the gin bottle
ain’t never goin’ to git together no more.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s me, all right, Sailor,” said Len slowly.</p>

<p>Sailor came slowly to the steps and stopped.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s you, Len,” he said softly. “It’s you
jist as sure as the Lord made little apples. You
ain’t changed. Nossir, you ain’t changed—much.
Len!” He shoved out a skinny hand. “My gosh,
I’m shore glad to see yuh again!”</p>

<p>“Hey!” yelled Whispering from inside the house.
He had heard Sailor say Len’s name, and out he
came, with a skillet in one hand and a rag in the
other.</p>

<p>He stopped short in the doorway, his mouth
sagging open. Whispering was nearly six feet tall
and would weigh two hundred and forty pounds.
His face was like a full moon—a fairly red moon,
too, and his head was as innocent of hair as a
billiard ball.</p>

<p>He dropped the skillet with a clang, strode out
and shoved Sailor inside.</p>

<p>“Git out and let him shake hands with a man!”
he blurted in his high-pitched voice. “Len, you
dern old pelican! Oh, you dog-gone rascal! Sneakin’
in on us thataway! Shut up, Sailor!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sayin’ anythin’.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t. Len, c’mon up here on the verandy
and let me look at yuh. Same person. Don’t say
anythin’, Sailor.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sayin’ anythin’.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, I tell yuh. I jist want to contemplate
Len.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help yuh,” grinned Sailor.</p>

<p>“I don’t need yuh. Go git some wood.”</p>

<p>Len laughed aloud for the first time since he
reached Lobo Wells, and Whispering patted him on
the arm.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to see you both,” he said. “In
fact, you don’t know how glad I am, boys. It’s good
to be back.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’ll betcha,” said Sailor. “You shore had
a long drag out there, didn’t yuh, Len. Five year.”</p>

<p>“It was a long time, Sailor—a mighty long
time.”</p>

<p>Whispering sighed and looked sidewise at Sailor,
who went creaking down the steps and headed for
the woodpile. Len chuckled softly and Whispering
shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Jist as ornery as ever, Len. Gittin’ old, I reckon.
C’mon in and watch me throw a feed together.”</p>

<p>They started in the house, when Whispering
stopped and turned to Len.</p>

<p>“You heard about Harmony?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>Len nodded.</p>

<p>“Jist awhile ago.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he’s dead, Len. Bronc drug him to death.
Reckon he got drunk, as usual. He drank pretty
heavy, yuh know. Me and Sailor tried to slow him
down. Even drank up his liquor, tryin’ to keep him
from gettin’ to it. That was Sailor’s idea. He gits
one once in a while. Well, come on in. Harmony
said he wrote yuh about yore—yore wife, Len. That
shore wasn’t no good news to send to a man in yore
position. But he said he had to do it, yuh know.
I see the kid once in a while. Looks like you, Len.
’Bout seven year old now, ain’t he? Uh-huh.
Good-lookin’ kid.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t seen him,” said Len slowly. “He
wouldn’t remember me, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s true. Still, he’s yore flesh and blood.
I said to Harmony that I’d hate to be in
Charley Prentice’s shoes when you came back,
Len.”</p>

<p>Len shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“Charles Prentice didn’t do me no dirt, Whisperin’.
I wasn’t blind. My wife was the wrong
woman for me, and she might as well have married
Charley as anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how yuh felt about her, Len.
Me and Harmony talked about her a lot, yuh see.
Of course she sold the place you had in town and
all yore horses, saddles and all them things. Harmony
was pretty mad. He tried to save somethin’
out of it, but it wasn’t no use. She comes out here
and talks with Harmony. Said she wanted to git
a line on some money you had. To hear her talk
you’d think it was a lot of money, Len. She knowed
that Harmony was yore best friend, and she thought
he’d know. But he said he didn’t know anythin’.
She got what was in the bank, but it wasn’t what
she expected, by any means.”</p>

<p>Len smiled thinly.</p>

<p>“I wonder if she meant the money they say I
stole?”</p>

<p>“No, that wasn’t it,” quickly. “She said it was
money you got when some kin of yours died in the
south. Said she never got on to it, until she found
an old letter of yours, after you went away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” grunted Len thoughtfully. “Well,
how’s this outfit gettin’ along, Whisperin’?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Yessir, it’s shore doin’ well. Old Harmony’s
made money here. He was thinkin’ of
puttin’ another man or two on the job. We’re
raisin’ cows, pardner. The three of us has handled
things fine, but she’s growin’ pretty big. The last
round-up count showed about a thousand head of
Box S brands, not countin’ horses. Harmony’s been
raisin’ a lot of horses. A year ago he sold a hundred
head to the United States for cavalry horses. Got
a hundred apiece for every danged one. And he
sold twenty head to a feller who wanted ’em for
polo, whatever that is. Got a top price for every
one of ’em. And he sold quite a bunch of steers to
a Chicago buyer, too.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll tell yuh, this ranch is shore on a payin’
basis. Betcha she’s payin’ better than the JP
right now, even if the JP is the biggest. Silver
Prescott keeps himself broke payin’ wages to a lot
of lazy punchers. The OK is doin’ right well, I
think. Oscar Knight was over here the other day
and he said everythin’ was fine. We don’t see many
of the boys these days. I’ll tell yuh, me and Sailor
has shore been busy. But”—Whispering shook his
head—“we dunno what it’s all about. Nobody
left to pay us wages. We don’t even know who
owns this here rancheria.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t worry about that,” said Len
slowly. “It will all come out in the wash.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. Well, here comes Sailor with six
sticks of wood. That’s his limit. How would yuh
like some dried apple pie?”</p>

<p>“You know how I used to like it, Whisperin’?”</p>

<p>“I shore do, Len.”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t had none for five years.”</p>

<h2 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III: THE MASQUERADING HEIRESS</h2>

<p>The trip from San Francisco to Lobo Wells had
seemed interminably long to Nan Whitlock, but
her nerve almost failed her when she heard the
brakeman calling: “Lo-o-o-bo Wells, next station!
Lo-o-o-bo Wells!”</p>

<p>Nan had rather shocked the landlady by paying
the rent the morning after Madge Allan had been
killed, and rather mystified the authorities, who
were looking for more information about Madge
Allan, only to find that Nan had faded out of the
picture. Mrs. Emmett had offered to turn Madge’s
trunk over to her, but Nan refused it. It had been
a simple matter to cash the hundred-dollar cheque.</p>

<p>But now she was facing the test, as the train
ground to a stop at the weather-beaten depot, and
she came down timidly, carrying a large valise.
She had not replied to the lawyer’s letter, so there
was no one at the station to meet her.</p>

<p>Except for a cowboy who leaned negligently
against a corner of the depot, watching the depot
agent and a brakeman unloading some stuff from
the express car, the platform was empty. After a
few moments the train went on and the cowboy
went into the station with the agent.</p>

<p>With the train out of the way, Nan was able to
get her first look at the town of Lobo Wells. And
her first impression was not a flattering one. The
station and tracks seemed to be a barrier across
one end of the main street, which was narrow, dusty,
with crooked wooden sidewalks and false-fronted
wooden buildings, many of them out of line.</p>

<p>Saddle horses nodded at the hitchracks in the
noonday sun, and a bunch of loose horses milled
around a corral behind a livery-stable, throwing
clouds of dust.</p>

<p>It was very hot there on the old platform. Pitch
oozed from the pine planks, and Nan could feel
the heat through the thin soles of her shoes. The
cowboy came from the station, stopped on the edge
of the platform and looked at her.</p>

<p>It was Len Ayres, but a different Len Ayres than
had come back to Lobo Wells three days before.
Whispering had loaned him enough money for a
new outfit of clothes, and Len had always been
slightly inclined to the gaudy, in raiment. His shirt
was a robin’s-egg blue, with scarlet muffler and a
tan sombrero. His chaps were a second-hand pair,
but nearly new, with fancy rosettes, cut in the
extreme of bat-wing type. His belt and gun were
the same he had worn before his arrest, having
been kept at the Box S by Harmony Singer.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, ma’am,” he said slowly.
“Were you lookin’ for somebody especial?”</p>

<p>“Well,—I suppose not,” replied Nan helplessly.
“Foolish of me to expect any one, because no one
knew when I was coming. But I wish you could
direct me to the office of an attorney by the name
of Baggs.”</p>

<p>Len started slightly, but nodded. This girl was
rather good-looking, evidently from the city, and
he wondered why she would come to Lobo Wells
to seek Amos Baggs.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know him?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know him, ma’am. Lemme pack that
valise, and I’ll take yuh up to his office. Do you
know Baggs?”</p>

<p>Nan shook her head as she surrendered the valise
to Len.</p>

<p>“No, I have never seen him.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Kinda hot to-day. We’ll hit the shady
side.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>Nan stole several glances at the hard-faced cowboy
with the greenish-gray eyes, as they walked
up the creaking sidewalk. He was the first cowboy
she had ever seen, except on the stage, and it struck
her that his raiment was a trifle theatrical, until she
saw several others, who were dressed much the
same. The big gun swinging from his hip looked
businesslike.</p>

<p>“Do you take care of cattle?” she asked.</p>

<p>A smile flashed across Len’s lips.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” he said shortly, and a moment later:
“This is Baggs’s office, ma’am,” indicating the
doorway just ahead of them. Len had not met
Baggs since his return, but as they came up to the
doorway, Baggs stepped out.</p>

<p>Amos Alexander Baggs was not a prepossessing
person, except for height, which was well over six
feet, exaggerated by thinness. His nearly bald
head showed some gray hair, weak eyes, a thin
nose, rather short for a long face, and a determined
mouth and chin. He wore a white collar and a
flowing black tie above what was once a fancy vest,
the rest of his raiment being rusty black, badly
wrinkled.</p>

<p>He jerked slightly at such close contact to the
man he had sent to the penitentiary, and blinked
his watery eyes at Nan.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Baggs,” said Len slowly.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for directing me and
carrying my bag.”</p>

<p>“Thasall right, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Len gave Baggs a hard glance, nodded to Nan,
and went across the street. Baggs looked after him
for a moment and then turned to Nan.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“About a letter you sent me,” said Nan. “I—I
am Madge Singer.”</p>

<p>Baggs’s eyes opened a trifle as he looked her over.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—yes! Come right in. I was wondering
about you. Just came in, eh? Didn’t know whether
you’d come or not. Mm-m-m-m. Much better than
I expected. Sit down there while I close the door.”</p>

<p>Nan sat down, while he bustled around, finally
coming back to his desk, which was strewn with
papers and books. He filled and lighted a cob pipe,
nervously tamping the tobacco with his skinny
forefinger. Pipe drawing to his satisfaction, he
turned to Nan.</p>

<p>“Well, well! What do you think of Lobo Wells?
Quite a place. I won’t go into any details, because
I suppose Jack Pollock has explained things. Knew
Jack well. Used to work for Harry Cole, over across
the street, when Cole first opened up. Him and
Harry were very close—very.</p>

<p>“Now the thing for you to do is to go to the
hotel, register for a room and stay there to-night.
The will has not been probated yet, but there’s no
reason why you can’t take over the ranch at once.
No argument, because there are no other heirs.
You will probably have to live at the ranch for a
month or two, you understand. But it’s a comfortable
place. I’ll go down to the hotel with you.
Pretty hot to-day, isn’t it? We get plenty of heat
here, but it’s healthful. You’ll be as brown as a
berry in a week. Look kinda pale. This will do
you good. Know who that puncher was—the one
who brought you here?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said Nan, her mind
in a whirl.</p>

<p>“That was Len Ayres. Just got back from serving
five years in prison. I was prosecuting attorney at
that time, and I secured his conviction. He pulled
some big robberies in this country, and he’s thoroughly
bad. The officers are watching him. By the
way, he’s staying out at your ranch. But we’ll
stop that. Two other old men out there. Been
there for years. Perhaps you better keep them on
the job. Friends of your late uncle.” Baggs laughed
crookedly and got to his feet.</p>

<p>“We’ll go down to the hotel now. Did you bring
a trunk?”</p>

<p>“I’m travelling light,” smiled Nan.</p>

<p>“That’s sensible. How is Jack Pollock?”</p>

<p>“He was all right the last time I saw him,”
said Nan truthfully.</p>

<p>“That’s fine.”</p>

<p>They were halfway back to the hotel, when
Baggs said:</p>

<p>“Do you know, I wasn’t looking for your type.
Not a bit. But I like you better. You look innocent.
I don’t mean any disrespect to either party,
but you’re not the kind of a girl that I’d expect
Jack Pollock to take up with. That’s a fact. I’ll
introduce you to Harry Cole as soon as convenient.
Just for your own sake, I’d advise you to keep away
from the cowboys around here. They’re a wild lot.”</p>

<p>Nan’s face was rather red, but it might have
been from the heat. She disliked Baggs, and she
couldn’t see why he should promise to introduce
her to Harry Cole. But she realised that, as Madge
Allan, she must understand what it was all about,
and she wondered how it would turn out.</p>

<p>Baggs registered for her, and went away while
the bearded proprietor showed her to a room in
the front of the two-story half-adobe hotel, which,
by comparison, made her last room in San Francisco
look like a palace.</p>

<p>“This ain’t no bridal sweet,” he told her, “but it
gives yuh a view of the street. Ain’t no ice water,
’cause there ain’t no ice, but we filter it pretty good.
You goin’ to be here long?”</p>

<p>“Not very.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, nobody stays long at a hotel.
You ain’t a drummer, are yuh?”</p>

<p>“Drummer?”</p>

<p>“Yeah—sellin’ things.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>

<p>“I seen yuh go past with Len Ayres. Know him
very well?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. He directed me to Mr. Baggs’s
office.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, Baggs can tell yuh all about
Len. He sent Len to the penitentiary. ’F I had
my choice between the two, I know which one I’d
take. Well, I hope you’ll be comfortable, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Which one would you take?” asked Nan,
hardly knowing why she asked the question.</p>

<p>The bearded man stopped at the door and grinned
back at her.</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’, ma’am, because I’ve got to live
here, and yuh can’t afford to cross-fire the law.”</p>

<h2 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV: THREATS</h2>

<p>Len Ayres went across the street to the Oasis
Saloon from where he watched Amos Baggs take
Nan to the hotel. When the lawyer went back to
his office, Len crossed the street and sauntered up
there.</p>

<p>He found Baggs at his desk, filling his pipe, but
the former prosecuting attorney seemed to lose
interest in his pipe when he looked up and saw Len.</p>

<p>Len eyed him close for several moments.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d drop in and renew old acquaintance,
Amos,” he said slowly. “You ain’t scared
of me, are yuh?”</p>

<p>Amos cleared his throat dryly and shifted his
feet.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should be afraid of you,
Ayres.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know. After the things you said about
me at that trial⸺”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s part of my job—was part of it, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t mean it, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Well—no, I didn’t mean much of it. You
see⸺”</p>

<p>“You meant part of it, didn’t yuh, Amos?—the
dirty and mean parts. But we’ll let that go. I’ve
paid the price. I remember yuh spoke about the
debt I owed to society. Well, I paid it, and I hope
the society you spoke about is satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Oh, everything is all right now, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s fine, Amos. You must feel better.
I remember yuh kinda talked as though you was
part of that society. You almost cried, if I remember
right. You said I was a menace. I don’t think you
lost any money in that robbery; so you must
have been sincere. But that’s all past and done;
so we might as well be friends, Amos. I was just
wonderin’ who the young lady is.”</p>

<p>Amos was visibly relieved. He had always
dreaded the day that Len Ayres might come back
to Lobo Wells, but it was turning out much better
than he had expected.</p>

<p>“That young lady is named Singer,” he told Len.
“Madge Singer. I reckon she was the only close
relative Harmony Singer had. Anyway, he made
out his will and left her everything he owned,
which included the Box S ranch and everything
on it, and any money he might have in the
bank.”</p>

<p>Len rubbed his nose vigorously and stared at
Baggs, who continued:</p>

<p>“She was his niece. Brother’s girl. He knew
where she was in San Francisco; so we got in
touch with her. He made out this will quite a while
ago, and I kept it here in my safe. Seems like a
nice girl, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-a-ah, she does,” drawled Len slowly.
“So she was a niece of Harmony Singer, eh? And
she’s over here to take charge of the property.
Goin’ to run the Box S, Amos?”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t mentioned her plans yet. It’s a
little too soon for her to know what she’s going to
do. I’ll take her out there to-morrow, and I think
she will take charge.”</p>

<p>“Did she ever live on a cow ranch?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. Looks like a sensible girl.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, she does. Well, well! Madge Singer.
Funny the old man didn’t never say anythin’ about
her to me.”</p>

<p>“I guess he didn’t know much about her before
you left. I never heard him mention her until about
a year ago. Seems that her father died and her
mother married again, or something like that. I
think he wrote to Harmony before he died and
told him about the girl.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, it’ll seem funny to have a
woman boss, Amos.”</p>

<p>“A woman boss? You ain’t goin’ to stay out
there, are you, Ayres?”</p>

<p>“Probably. She’ll need more help than she’s got
out there.”</p>

<p>“But—but she can hire plenty⸺”</p>

<p>“I don’t cost any more than the rest of ’em,
Amos.”</p>

<p>“I know that, but—well, that will be up to her,
of course.”</p>

<p>“And after you tell her what you know about
me, she’ll want somebody else, eh?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“No, but you meant it. Let me tell you something,
pardner: If that young lady tells me that
she don’t want me on that ranch, I’ll know who
advised her. For five years I’ve wanted a chance
to whittle off your damn ears, Amos Baggs. A while
ago we agreed to be friends, didn’t we? Well, you
play the game on the square or there’ll be whittlin’
done.”</p>

<p>“You can’t threaten me, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“No, but I can make you a promise.”</p>

<p>Amos Baggs turned away, rubbing his palms on
the arms of his chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you ever came back here,” he
said pettishly. “You’d be better off a long ways
from here.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of things you don’t know, Amos.
But there’s one thing you do know—you value your
ears.”</p>

<p>Amos swung around in his chair, his weak eyes
snapping.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you something, Ayres. Everybody
knows you came back here to dig up that money
you stole, and you might care to know that the
officers are watching every move you make. And
just remember, if they catch you with that money
you took from the Wells Fargo—you’ll pay for that
mighty steep.”</p>

<p>Len smiled thinly. It amused him to see Amos
Baggs mad.</p>

<p>“Sheriff Ben Dillon and Breezy Hill, eh? Amos,
those two boys are fine fellers, but they have trouble
every mornin’ findin’ their own hats. If they do
catch me, I’ll split with you and save my skin.
Is that a bargain?”</p>

<p>“You get to hell out of my office!”</p>

<p>Len turned and walked out, leaving Baggs to
fume over his pipe. Finally the lawyer got to his
feet, flung the pipe on the desk and walked down
to the bank. Charley Prentice looked up from his
work as Baggs leaned against the bank railing.</p>

<p>Prentice was a man about forty years of age,
sallow, nervous. He dressed well, as befitted his
position.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen Len Ayres?” asked Baggs softly,
although only a bookkeeper was in the bank with
Prentice.</p>

<p>Prentice glanced toward the door, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“I knew he was back, Amos. Is he bitter? You
know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Bitter?” Amos smiled crookedly. “I suppose
he is. Len never was noted for having a charitable
disposition, Charley.”</p>

<p>“Say anything about me?”</p>

<p>“Not to me.”</p>

<p>Prentice twisted a pencil nervously between his
fingers.</p>

<p>“The kid, Larry, knows he came back, Amos.
Some of the kids told him, and he asked me about
it. They made fun of him about his dad coming
back from prison, but the kid didn’t understand.
We never told him about Len.”</p>

<p>“That don’t affect you. Forget that part of it.
Don’t let him bluff you, Charley. He tried to bluff
me, but I showed him I couldn’t be bluffed. You’re
not afraid of him, are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Prentice.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I’m</i> not.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> never married his wife.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t do that.”</p>

<p>Some people came in the bank and Amos went
back to his office, where he filled his pipe again,
after which he strolled down to the sheriff’s office.</p>

<p>Ben Dillon, the sheriff, was in the office, but his
greeting was none too pleasant. Ben had been
elected to office fresh from a cow-ranch farther
down the valley, and he hated the clerical end of
his job.</p>

<p>Ben was fat, and ordinarily good-natured, but
he disliked Amos Baggs, because Amos acted
superior, because of his vast knowledge of law, and
tried to instruct Ben in office duties.</p>

<p>“What’s on yore mind now?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Nothing much, sheriff. You know that Len
Ayres is back, of course.”</p>

<p>“Shore do. What about him? Ain’t he got a
right to be here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose he has. But you know what folks
are saying.”</p>

<p>“About him comin’ back to dig up what he
stole? Shore.”</p>

<p>Ben stretched his legs and began rolling a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that the natural thing for him to do,
Baggs?”</p>

<p>“Natural, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what yuh mean. I’ve heard a lot
about it. Fact of the matter is, I’ve been notified
to watch him. Uh-huh! Grab him if he shows up
with money. I’ve got a hell of a lot of time to trail
Len Ayres around these hills, watchin’ for him to
dig up a pot of gold! Know what I told ’em? I
sent a wire to Wells Fargo and told ’em to send
their own detectives in to watch him. I’m here
for the suppression of crime—not to hunt for
hidden treasure.”</p>

<p>Ben laughed softly over his cigarette.</p>

<p>“Personally, I’m not interested, Mr. Baggs,
attorney-at-law; and it’s none of yore damn
business, as far as I can see. You ain’t prosecutin’
attorney of this here county this season; so I don’t
know why yo’re hornin’ in. ’F I remember right,
you said a lot of nasty things about Len Ayres,
when you sent him over the road, and since he
came back, I’ve been listenin’ for you to holler for
help. I’ll tell him that yo’re still interested in his
future, and that you warned me to keep an eye on
him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to do that,” quickly. “I
merely talked it over with you, sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Crawfishin’, eh?” laughed Ben. “Do yuh
know, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised to see you lose
yore ears, Baggs.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>Ben removed his cigarette, stared for a moment
at Baggs, and emitted a deep chuckle of amusement.</p>

<p>“Some one else had the same idea?”</p>

<p>Baggs turned and walked out of the office, while
Ben slapped himself on the thigh and grinned widely.</p>

<p>“If that bat-eared owl thought he was goin’ to
get sympathy from me, he shore knows better now,”
he told himself. “I ain’t playin’ no brotherly love
act with Len Ayres, and I’ll slap him in jail as
quick as I would any thief, but I wouldn’t give
Baggs that much satisfaction. And that jigger is
worried about his ears, I’ll tell myself that much.”</p>

<h2 id='chV'>CHAPTER V: OWNER OF THE BOX S</h2>

<p>“Nossir! Not now nor never! Why, listen, Len—aw,
that’s onreasonable. No danged female could
run a cow ranch. I tell yuh, I won’t stand for it.
Me and Sailor has talked it over among us, and he
feels the same as I do. Of course, his opinion ain’t
worth nothin’, as far as that is concerned, but we’re
ready to step right out when she comes.”</p>

<p>Whispering Taylor waved his arms a few times,
kicked a stick of wood under the stove, and glared
at Len Ayres, who was tilted back in a chair against
the kitchen wall, hands locked around his knees.</p>

<p>“Step out where, Whisperin’?” he asked calmly.</p>

<p>“That’s the whole trouble, Len. Me and Sailor
ain’t as young as we used to was. I might git a job
cookin’ some’ers, but old Sailor’s a total loss on the
job question. Jist a couple of old derelicts. Len,
it’s awful to git old, don’tcha know it?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s right, Whisperin’. If I was in
yore place, I’d stay here—if she’ll keep yuh—and I
think she will. Looks like a sensible girl. Of course,
she’d be advised by Baggs, but he’s a friend of
mine, and I’ll ask him to tell her to keep you and
Sailor.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t tryin’ to be comical, are yuh, Len?”
Whisperin’ asked.</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“About you and Amos Baggs bein’ friends.”</p>

<p>“No-o. He’ll do what I ask, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh?” dubiously. He walked to the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>“That’s enough wood, Sailor!” he yelled.</p>

<p>“Fetch in both sticks, will yuh?”</p>

<p>Sailor came staggering in with an armful of wood,
which he flung down with a great clatter.</p>

<p>“Think yo’re funny, don’tcha?” he asked
Whisperin’. “I’ll betcha I can cut more wood in
a day than you can. Betcha forty dollars, I
can.”</p>

<p>“What’ll yuh use for money, you spittin’ old
badger?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got the money.”</p>

<p>“You have not. Sailor, me and Len has decided
that the best thing for me and you to do is to stay
right here.”</p>

<p>“You and Len has, eh? I ain’t got a thing to
say about it, eh? Well, I’m not stayin’. No danged
female can tell me what to do.”</p>

<p>“Where’d yuh go, you old ram?” asked Whisperin’.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d find a job, I’m three years younger
than you are, Whisperin’, I—I can get a job.”</p>

<p>“What doin’?”</p>

<p>“Punchin’ cows.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, you could! Can’t even fork a gentle
horse.”</p>

<p>“You tryin’ to pick a fight with me, Whisperin’?”</p>

<p>“Fight, hell! I never fight with kids. Go out
on the porch and quarrel with Len; I’ve got to
cook a meal.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Amos Baggs had secured a
livery-stable rig and was bringing Nan out to the
Box S. The road was rutty, and the buggy springs
threatened to throw them both out at any time,
so conversation was limited.</p>

<p>“Of course, you’ll take charge of the place,”
explained Baggs. “I’ll handle all the details.
Pollock said you had plenty of nerve, and he’s a
good judge of women. I suppose you might as well
keep those two old men. One is a very good cook.
And I have decided that you will keep Len Ayres.
He is a good cow-man and can advise you in everything
in that line.”</p>

<p>“You mean the man who just came back from
prison?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“But is he a safe person to have around?”
smiled Nan.</p>

<p>Baggs’s right hand went instinctively to his ear,
but jerked back quickly.</p>

<p>“I—I think so,” he faltered. “We’ll give him
a trial. Try to make the best of it, because it’s well
worth your while. I’ll keep you instructed.”</p>

<p>They drove in at the front of the ranch house,
and Len met them. Whispering and Sailor stayed
in the kitchen, eyeing each other, as they heard
Len talking to Nan. The three of them came in
the house together.</p>

<p>“I reckon you better occupy Harmony’s old
room,” said Len. “It’s the best in the place.”</p>

<p>Len led the way, carrying Nan’s valise. It was a
rather small room, with one big window and a single
bed. The floor was covered with Navaho rugs and
on the walls were some old pictures. The top of an
old dresser was covered with a piece of calfskin,
hair-side up, and above the dresser hung two
Winchester rifles, while twisted around a head-post
of the bed was an old cartridge belt, supporting a
holstered Colt.</p>

<p>“I suppose we may as well remove the guns,”
said Baggs.</p>

<p>“Not on my account,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“But you won’t want that six-shooter at the
head of your bed,” said Baggs.</p>

<p>“Leave it there, please,” replied Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you really care for it.”</p>

<p>He turned to Len, in whose eyes was a glint of
amusement.</p>

<p>“Miss Singer has decided to keep you, Ayres,”
he said. “You will help her run the place.”</p>

<p>Len bowed shortly.</p>

<p>“I’ll be going back now,” said Baggs. “I will
keep in touch with you, Miss Singer.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Baggs.”</p>

<p>She and Len walked out on the porch and watched
Baggs ride back down the road. Len leaned against
a porch-post, his eyes very sombre, as he watched
the dust cloud settle behind Baggs’s equipage.
Nan brushed a lock of hair from her forehead and
studied Len’s profile for several moments.</p>

<p>“You don’t like him, do you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Baggs? No, I don’t reckon I do.”</p>

<p>“He asked me to keep you here.”</p>

<p>“Well, that shore was thoughtful of him,” smiled
Len.</p>

<p>“Knock us down to the lady, will yuh?”</p>

<p>Len turned quickly. Just outside the door stood
Whispering and Sailor, side by side, as stiff as a pair
of statues; Whispering’s huge frame entirely blotting
out the doorway, while little Sailor, his legs bowed
a trifle, seemed less than half the size of his big
companion.</p>

<p>“Me and the kid want to meet the lady,” said
Whispering, indicating Sailor with a jerk of a huge
thumb.</p>

<p>Their actions were so ludicrous that Nan wanted
to scream, but they were in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>“Miss Singer,” said Len hoarsely, “I want yuh
to meet Whisperin’ Taylor and Sailor Jones.</p>

<p>“Boys, this is Miss Singer, the new owner of the
Box S.”</p>

<p>“T’meetcha,” said Sailor, jerking his head
nervously.</p>

<p>“Shore a pleasure, ma’am,” said Whispering,
and Sailor gave him a glance filled with disgust.</p>

<p>Nan held out her hand to Whispering, who looked
at it, looked at her, but finally shook hands gently.
The small, white hand looked too frail for him to
essay a real handshake. Sailor didn’t wait for a
handshake, but went back in the house.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Whispering resignedly, “the place
belongs to you, ma’am. We’re at yore beck and
call, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you at my beck and call,” said Nan.
“You will do just as you have been in the habit of
doing.”</p>

<p>“Minus the profanity,” added Len, grinning.</p>

<p>“Oh, shore—shore,” Whispering studied Nan’s
face closely. “Yeah, I can see old Harmony in
yuh, ma’am. Yore eyes are kinda like hisn, except
his was brown. Yore uncle was a man. One of
the whitest men on earth, I tell yuh. His word
was as good as a gold bond. He played the game
according to rules.”</p>

<p>Nan blinked quickly. These two men seemed to
be measuring her to see if she came up to the
standard of Harmony Singer.</p>

<p>“Well, I—I hope I can make good,” she said.
But she looked at Len Ayres, and his greenish-gray
eyes seemed to accuse her of a lie.</p>

<p>“You’ll make good,” he said softly. “After all,
all yuh need to do is to be honest and play the game
on the square.”</p>

<p>“Be honest and play the game on the square,”
she repeated to herself as she sat in her room a
few minutes later. Did he suspect that she wasn’t
on the square, she wondered?</p>

<p>She could hear the men talking in the kitchen,
and she opened her door just a few inches.</p>

<p>“By God, I never shook her hand!” said Sailor.
“I never did kowtow to no woman. I may work
for her, but I’ll not shake her hand, Whisperin’.
You acted like a plumb fool over her. Yeah, yuh
did! Didn’t I hear yuh say that her eyes looked
like the ones Harmony had? I shore did. Makin’
a fuss over her eyes!”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s nice, ain’t she?” asked Whispering
mildly.</p>

<p>“Nice? Oh, I s’pose she’s nice. Huh! I seen
Len makin’ eyes at her, too. I sh’d think he’d had
enough of wimmin. Last one married ag’in almost
before the gate closed behind him. Well, it’s his
business, I reckon. I know I don’t want her.”</p>

<p>“By golly, that ort to relieve her, Sailor. I’ll
betcha she’s tremblin’ in her room, waitin’ for
somebody to tell her that you don’t want her. Say,
git me some wood. I’m minglin’ a reg’lar feed for
this evenin’.”</p>

<p>“Panderin’ to her stummick?”</p>

<p>“I’ll pander to the seat of yore overalls, if yuh
don’t shut yore yap and git out of here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll go all right. You burn more wood than
any danged cook I ever seen. You ort to git a job
in the North Woods. You’d burn all the timber
on a quarter section jist to bake one pan of biscuits.”</p>

<p>The kitchen door slammed shut. There was
silence for several moments, broken by a rattle of
tin dishes in the kitchen, and then Whisperin’s voice
raised in song:</p>

<blockquote>

<div>“‘Oh, glory be to me!’ says he, ‘and fame’s unfadin’ flowers,</div>
<div>I ride my good top hoss to-day, and I’m top hand of the Lazy J,</div>
<div style='text-indent:2em'>So Kitty-cat, you’re ours!’”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Came a verse of unintelligible words, and another
chorus:</p>

<blockquote>

<div>“‘Oh, glory be to me!’ says he, ‘we’ll hit the glory trail.</div>
<div>No man has lopped a lion’s head and lived to drag the critter dead,</div>
<div style='text-indent:2em'>Till I shall tell the tale.’”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>It was the old southern Arizona cowboy song of
High-Chin Bob, who tried to subdue a mountain
lion alone with a rope. Old Whisperin’s voice
quavered through the last chorus as Sailor came in
to crash down his armful of wood.</p>

<p>“Singin’ to her already, eh?” he sneered.</p>

<p>“You didn’t want her, didja, Sailor?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to see you make a fool of yoreself
at yore age, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>Nan softly closed her door and threw herself on
the bed for a good cry, but the tears would not come.
Instead she laughed rather hysterically. For some
reason or other she couldn’t find anything to cry
about, so she sat up, powdered her nose and tried
to think calmly.</p>

<p>“You are a despicable liar,” she told her image
in the old mirror. “Just a common thief, Nan
Whitlock. You were weak enough to get into this
mess; now get yourself out clean.”</p>

<h2 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI: REPUTATIONS</h2>

<p>That night Charley Prentice got as drunk as the
proverbial boiled owl. For several years Prentice
had totally abstained from all liquor, but this night
he drank himself blind drunk at the Oasis and took
two quarts of whisky home with him.</p>

<p>It was nothing unusual for a man to get drunk
in Lobo Wells, but for a man in Charley Prentice’s
position it was not quite the right thing. Harry
Cole had tried to dissuade him, but he refused to
accept advice.</p>

<p>“You don’t want that stuff, Charley,” said Cole.
“You can’t afford to fill yore skin with hard
liquor.”</p>

<p>“Lemme alone,” said Charley owlishly. “My
business.”</p>

<p>And Amos Baggs, not at all a teetotaller, looked
with disfavour upon Charley. He had a few drinks
with Charley, arguing against it all the time, but
Charley was too drunk to care what Amos thought.</p>

<p>After Charley staggered away with his two bottles,
Amos conferred with Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s all wrong,” said Amos. “He’s been
sober and clear-minded for a long time. And you
know Charley. What’s wrong with him, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Scared,” said Cole softly. “He’s scared of Len
Ayres. I’ve always told yuh that Prentice is a damn
yellow pup, Amos. Drinkin’ to hide the yellow.
He kept talkin’ to me, just when he starts to drink
this evenin’, and he kept wonderin’ why Len came
back. I told him to forget it. Damn him, he snivels
when he gets drunk. Scared of his shadder.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he’d do anythin’ foolish, do
yuh, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ more than get drunk. To-morrow is
Sunday, so he can sober up—if he wants to. But
he took two quarts with him; so it don’t look so
good.”</p>

<p>“I had a run-in with Len,” said Amos. He had
imbibed enough to expand a little. “He started in
to talk smart to me, but he didn’t get far with it.
He’s got it in for both of us, Harry. Let’s have a
drink.”</p>

<p>They turned to the bar.</p>

<p>“I was talkin’ to Ben Dillon to-day,” said Cole.
“He said that the Wells Fargo people evidently
think Len came back here to dig up the money he
stole from them.”</p>

<p>“He told me about it,” nodded Amos, filling his
glass to the brim. It was not often that he bought
a drink. “Said he told them to put their own
detective on the job. Harry, I’m of the candid
opinion that Ben is about as much of a sheriff as
you were.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t so bad,” laughed Cole.</p>

<p>“No, you were all right, Harry. I’d like to see
you in office again.”</p>

<p>“Not me. Oh, I had enough of it. Well, here’s
regards.”</p>

<p>But Charley Prentice did not sober up the next
day. Amos went out to see him, intending to read
him a temperance lesson, but Charley was stretched
out on a couch, soggy drunk. Minnie, the Indian
woman, who did the cooking and housework, was
on the porch with the little boy, who was a miniature
edition of Len Ayres.</p>

<p>“Charley Prentice drunk,” said the squaw,
explaining the whole thing in three words.</p>

<p>“How are you, Larry?” asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Aw right,” replied the boy. “I’ve been talking
to Minnie about my other dad, but she don’t do
much, except grunt. What do you know about
him, Mr. Baggs?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, Larry,” said Baggs thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, you do know. All the kids know about
him.”</p>

<p>“What did they tell you?”</p>

<p>“They said he’d been in prison for stealing
money.”</p>

<p>“Mm-m-m-m—well, that’s about the size of it,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“But he’s my dad, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he is. But Charley Prentice is your
dad now.”</p>

<p>“How do you figure that out? How many dads
can a feller have, anyway?”</p>

<p>Baggs took great pains to explain to Larry just
how it happened that his name was Prentice. The
boy listened.</p>

<p>“Aw right,” he said defiantly. “Then my name
ain’t Prentice, it’s Ayres. Len Ayres is my father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true, Larry. After he was sent to
prison, your mother married Charley Prentice.
You were two years old at that time. But wouldn’t
you rather have a father who is cashier of a bank
than to have one just out of prison?”</p>

<p>“Can I take my pick?”</p>

<p>Baggs laughed softly. “I suppose you can,
Larry. Mr. Prentice has been mighty good to you,
young fellow, and you will be very wise to stay
with him. If you want my advice⸺”</p>

<p>“You said I could take my pick,” reminded the
boy quickly.</p>

<p>“You listen to me, young man.” Baggs’s voice
assumed authority. “You are just at the age when
you need some one capable of looking after your
welfare. You are not old enough to judge for yourself.
Charley Prentice can do this; Ayres can’t.
For all you know, he may be back in prison within
a month, and then you would be a county charge.
Know what that means? No, of course not. Well,
you stick to Charley Prentice.”</p>

<p>Baggs adjusted his hat and walked away, leaving
the boy looking after him with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s a county charge, Minnie?” he asked</p>

<p>“Dunno,” grunted the squaw.</p>

<p>“You don’t know much, do you, Minnie?”</p>

<p>“Know I don’t like Baggs.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I feel the same way about it. I wish I
could talk with Len Ayres, Minnie. He wears blue
shirts and red handkerchiefs. I seen him the other
day, but he didn’t see me. What do you suppose
Mr. Baggs meant about him maybe goin’ back to
prison in a month?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” grunted Minnie. “He don’t say sure.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I guess maybe I’ll have to see him.”</p>

<p>“I guess I go make pie. You go play with kids.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to play with kids. I want to be a
cowpuncher, Minnie.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” grunted Minnie. “Good job.”</p>

<p>Larry wandered away. He didn’t want to play
with the other boys; so he wended his way down to
the sheriff’s office, where he found Breezy Hill, the
deputy. Breezy was long-faced, bony of face and
body, with bushy eyebrows and a shock of sandy
hair, which stood up like the roach on a grizzly bear.
One side of his face bulged with a huge chew of
tobacco most of the time.</p>

<p>“Hyah, Larry!” he called, when the boy stopped
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Hyah,” grinned Larry. “Whatcha doin’?”</p>

<p>“Meditatin’ on my sins,” seriously.</p>

<p>“What’s a sin?”</p>

<p>“A sin?” Breezy spat thoughtfully, and Larry
came in beside the desk. “That’s kinda hard to
answer, Larry. But it ’pears to me that a sin is
somethin’ we all want to commit, but we’re scared
of what folks will say.”</p>

<p>“Would folks say somethin’?”</p>

<p>“Would they?” explosively. “Good gosh. I’ll
say they would! I’d almost bet that ninety per
cent. of the conversation of folks deal with the sins
of somebody else. You know what I mean? They
talk about the wrong things somebody else has
done.”</p>

<p>“Like that talk about my dad?”</p>

<p>Breezy blinked thoughtfully for a few moments.
“Yeah,” softly. “I reckon. You don’t remember
him, do yuh?”</p>

<p>“Does that make any difference, Breezy?”</p>

<p>“Yo’re a queer little cuss, Larry. What do yuh
mean?”</p>

<p>“He remembers me, don’t he?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he don’t!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Baggs says I must stay with Mr. Prentice,
or I’ll be a charge on the county.”</p>

<p>“Amos Baggs said that, eh? You ain’t payin’
him for advice, are yuh, Larry? Yuh know a
lawyer charges to tell folks what to do.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t pay him nothin’.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff! Don’t pay him anythin’. If
he makes a yelp, you send him to me. I’ll bend a
gun over his head.”</p>

<p>Larry stared at Breezy for a moment, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be a sin, Breezy?”</p>

<p>“Ord’narily it is, Larry; but when yuh pick the
right person, it’s a favour to the rest of the world
How’s yore—how’s Mr. Prentice to-day?”</p>

<p>“Drunk.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah? Gosh, that’s somethin’ new.”</p>

<p>“I never seen him drunk before.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Breezy masticated rapidly. He knew
that Prentice had not been drunk for a long time,
and he wondered why the cashier of the Lobo
Wells Bank had fallen off the water wagon.</p>

<p>A man stepped off a horse at the little hitchrack
in front of the office and came to the doorway. It
was Len Ayres. Little Larry’s eyes were as big as
quarters.</p>

<p>“Hyah, Len,” said Breezy pleasantly. “Whatcha
know?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much, Breezy.”</p>

<p>Len came in, his spur chains jingling, looked
sharply at the boy, and then at Breezy. It was the
first time he had seen his son in over five years.</p>

<p>“Don’tcha recognise this young feller, Len?”
asked Breezy.</p>

<p>Father and son looked at each other steadily.
The boy was backed against the side of the desk,
and it seemed as though he had stopped breathing.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I believe I do,” said Len slowly, and
then held out his hand. “Hello, little pardner.”</p>

<p>Shyly the boy shook hands with him, swallowing
heavily.</p>

<p>“Mighty nice kid,” said Breezy huskily. “Me
and him have become good friends, Len. He’s
smart.”</p>

<p>Len nodded slowly, his eyes on the boy.</p>

<p>“How are yuh, Larry?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m fine.”</p>

<p>“That’s great, Larry; you shore look good.”</p>

<p>“Looks jist like you, Len,” said Breezy.</p>

<p>For several moments none of them spoke.</p>

<p>Then the boy said: “My name ain’t Prentice;
it’s Ayres.”</p>

<p>Len lifted his head and looked at Breezy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Baggs said I could have my choice,” continued
the boy, “but he said if I didn’t stay with
Mr. Prentice I’d be a charge on the county.”</p>

<p>Len winced, but the muscles of his lean jaws
tightened. “Mr. Baggs said that, did he, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Just a while ago. He came out to see da—Mr.
Prentice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah. And what did Mr. Prentice say
about it?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, because he was drunk and
asleep.”</p>

<p>“Drunk?” Len looked questioningly at Breezy.</p>

<p>“Somethin’ new,” said Breezy quickly. “First
time he’s been drunk in years, Len. The kid never
seen him drunk before.”</p>

<p>“No, I never did,” supplemented Larry. “First
time. He’s got two bottles with him.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Baggs came out to see him, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He comes out there every little while.
They’re good friends.”</p>

<p>Len nodded slowly.</p>

<p>“Do yuh go to school, Larry?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; this was my second term. I’m in the
second grade.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s fine. You don’t remember me, do
yuh, Larry? No, of course yuh couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember you. Nobody ever told me
about you, until the kids did.”</p>

<p>“What kids?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the kids I play with. They said they heard
about you at home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see—heard about me at home. I’m sorry,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“Sorry I heard about you?”</p>

<p>“Sorry for <i>what</i> you heard about me.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right now, ain’t it? It was just a sin.
Breezy says that sin is somethin’ we all want to do,
but we’re scared what folks will say about us.
You wasn’t scared, I guess.”</p>

<p>Len’s mouth sagged a little. Perhaps he never
expected to hear this from the mouth of a little
boy. He glanced sharply at Breezy, who seemed to
be choking over his tobacco.</p>

<p>“No,” said Len softly, “I reckon I wasn’t
scared, Larry, and I’m glad that you think it’s all
right now. I don’t know of anybody I’d rather have
feel thataway.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Larry. “The kids say you’ve
got pots and pots of money buried somewhere, and
you came back to dig it up.”</p>

<p>Len blinked rapidly, shook his head at Breezy,
and walked back to the doorway, where he looked
out at the street.</p>

<p>Larry walked over to him and touched his hand.</p>

<p>“You ain’t mad, are you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Len turned impulsively and took the earnest little
face between his two big hands.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not mad, little pardner. I reckon I’ve
got to stand for what folks say. It’s all right. Just
don’t believe everythin’ yuh hear, ’cause it ain’t all
true. When the devil paints some of us, he kinda
leaves the colours to folks’ imagination, and some of
’em pick strong colours.”</p>

<p>“Did the devil paint you?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I reckon he did, Larry.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look it.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. It shows that you are my friend,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t friends see those colours?”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t be friends if they did, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well,” Larry sighed, “I suppose I
better go home. Minnie will have dinner ready, and
she’ll be callin’ me.”</p>

<p>“All right, pardner; I’ll see yuh later.”</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Larry went up the street,
looking back at his father.</p>

<p>“Can yuh beat that, Len?” said Breezy, coming
to the door to watch the boy out of sight.</p>

<p>“No, yuh can’t, Breezy. That kid is deep, I tell
yuh. There’s a lot of stuff in his little head. But it
don’t seem like he’s my kid. He was such a little
geezer when I went away, and now he talks like a
man. Breezy”—Len lifted his chin, the lines of his
face tightening quickly—“I want that boy. I
didn’t never think much about it since I came back.
Seems that he’d growed away from me, but right
now I want him. He’s a man’s boy, that little feller.
But when yuh come right down to cases, I ain’t
got no right to him; not with my reputation.”</p>

<p>“The law can’t stop yuh, Len. Charley Prentice
never adopted him. He’s yore son.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that, Breezy. He’s only seven,
and he don’t savvy what his dad—don’t savvy my
reputation. After a while he’ll realise what it all
means, and then mebbe he won’t have no respect
for me.”</p>

<p>“That kid,” declared Breezy warmly, “won’t
never go back on yuh, Len.”</p>

<p>“Shore nice of yuh to say that, Breezy. Mebbe
yo’re right, but it’s a chance. What do yuh think
of Prentice gettin’ drunk?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. Ain’t no crime, unless yuh go too far.
A feller in his position hadn’t ort to drink much.
But I reckon it’s his business. Lord knows, Prentice
is old enough to know what he wants. How’s things
at the Box S? What about that girl?”</p>

<p>Len shook his head, and a smile creased his lips.</p>

<p>“Who knows, Breezy? She don’t know a thing
about the job. But she’s willin’ to admit it. Whisperin’
and Sailor are already quarrellin’ over her.
But that’s nothin’ new; they quarrel over religion,
politics, love and war. Whisperin’ is nice to the
girl, and Sailor swears Whisperin’s in love with her.
Neither of them realise that they are growing old.
Sailor won’t have nothin’ to do with her.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she laughs at both of ’em, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so, Breezy. She ain’t that
kind.”</p>

<p>“City girl, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. She’s made me foreman. Said
Baggs advised it.”</p>

<p>“Holy gosh! Baggs advised—oh, no, Len!”</p>

<p>“Well, she says he did.”</p>

<p>“What do yuh suppose struck him?”</p>

<p>“His ears burned, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Breezy thought it over for a moment, and laughed.
“Yuh mean that somebody was talkin’ about
him?”</p>

<p>“He knew somebody was thinkin’ about him,
Breezy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t savvy it, Len, but that’s all right. Folks
usually have to write it out for me. It kinda
surprised me to hear that Baggs advised it. The
whole country talked about the things he said at
yore trial, and lots o’ folks said that you’d come
back some day and squeeze his Adam’s apple until
the juice choked him to death.”</p>

<p>Len laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Baggs is worth more to me alive than dead,
Breezy. Well, I reckon I’ll be travellin’ along. Be
good, old-timer.”</p>

<p>“Same to you, Len.”</p>

<p>He watched Len mount his bay horse and ride
out of town.</p>

<p>“Worth more alive than dead,” repeated Breezy
to himself. “Now, what did he mean by that, do
yuh suppose? Oh, well, he’s deep, Len is. If I
was in his place, I’d never stop to consider the worth
of anybody. But I shore pity Baggs if Len ever
thinks his usefulness is over.”</p>

<h2 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII: A WARNING</h2>

<p>Nan’s first week at the Box S was so interesting
that she forgot to be lonesome. Len found a gentle
horse for her to ride, and bought her a pair of
overalls, shirt and wide hat at Lobo Wells.</p>

<p>Side-saddles were unknown in that country. She
suffered in silence, and by the end of the week most
of the soreness had subsided, giving her a chance to
enjoy riding. Either Len or Sailor rode with her,
and sometimes they both took her along. Sailor
didn’t like it. He was woman-shy, and didn’t care
who knew it.</p>

<p>Whisperin’ stayed at the ranch, doing the cooking
and chuckling at Sailor’s discomfiture. Their arguments
lasted far into the night, neither of them
conceding a point.</p>

<p>It was Friday morning when Amos Baggs rode
out again. Nan was alone in the house, but the men
were down at the corral. Baggs sat down and
inquired as to her health and the state of affairs
at the ranch. He said he was sorry not to have
been out sooner, but business had kept him in town.</p>

<p>“I’ve got everything fixed up at the bank,” he
said, as he drew out a cheque and placed it on the
table. “If you will just sign this cheque, Miss
Singer.”</p>

<p>Nan looked at the cheque, which had been drawn
in favour of A. A. Baggs for the sum of one thousand
dollars. She looked at Baggs, her eyes a trifle wide.</p>

<p>“What is this for?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My fee for handling the case,” he smiled. “Just
sign your name, and everything is fine.”</p>

<p>Nan hesitated, and a moment later Len came in.
He had seen Baggs’s horse and buggy at the front
of the house.</p>

<p>He nodded coldly at Baggs, stopping just inside
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Nan. “It—it doesn’t
seem right for me to be signing cheques just yet.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Len.</p>

<p>“Just a matter of signing a cheque covering my
fee,” said Baggs coldly. “It doesn’t concern you,
Ayres.”</p>

<p>“For how much?” asked Len, paying no attention
to Baggs.</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars,” replied Nan.</p>

<p>“Don’t sign it. This will hasn’t been probated
yet.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” said Baggs hotly.
“Everything is in order, as far as the will is
concerned.”</p>

<p>“It’s never in order until the court passes on it,
Baggs.”</p>

<p>Baggs got to his feet, his lean jaws working
violently.</p>

<p>“Just what right have you to advise this woman,
Ayres?”</p>

<p>“I’m her foreman, Baggs. She don’t know much
about this business. She ain’t got no more right
to sign that cheque than I have, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that I’ve got to wait another
month, until court opens again, before I can get
my just fees from this case?” Baggs laughed
shortly. “What do you know about the law,
Ayres?”</p>

<p>“Plenty. You take my advice and get off this
ranch.”</p>

<p>Baggs almost exploded with wrath. “Me get
off? Off this ranch?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t have any trouble,” said Nan
hastily.</p>

<p>“It won’t be any trouble,” grinned Len. “Baggs
knows it won’t, as well as I do. You pull out, Baggs.
When that will has been probated properly, and
Miss Singer has the right, she’ll sign yore cheque,
but not before.”</p>

<p>Baggs left, and as far as they could see, and hear
him, he was whipping the horse and talking to
himself.</p>

<p>“Was that the right thing to do?” asked Nan
dubiously.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” smiled Len. “You don’t own this
property until the court says the will is all right.
Oh, there probably won’t be any argument about it
in this country, even if you signed the cheque now,
but you can’t be too careful. And that fee is pretty
stiff in a small case like this.”</p>

<p>“I want to do the right thing,” said Nan
softly.</p>

<p>“That’s fine. You don’t mind if I call yuh Madge,
do yuh? Out in this country we usually call folks
by their first names, yuh know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind, Len.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lot better.”</p>

<p>“But my folks always called me Nan. My name
is really Madge, but”—Nan thought quickly—“they
called me Nan.”</p>

<p>“Kind of a nickname, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like it better than Madge. Fits yuh
better.”</p>

<p>Baggs went back to town in a towering rage, his
horse all a-lather, and turned it over to the stable-keeper,
who was a trifle particular how his stock was
treated.</p>

<p>“Didja win the race?” he asked Baggs sarcastically,
but the Lobo Wells lawyer strode away
without any reply.</p>

<p>“Acts like he’d lost two bits,” reflected the
stableman, as he rubbed down the horse.</p>

<p>Baggs went back to his office and filled his pipe,
but he was too mad to smoke. Breezy Hill came
sauntering along and stopped in the doorway.
Baggs glared at the deputy and went back to his
pipe.</p>

<p>“If Charley Prentice don’t lay off the booze,
he’ll see a lotta pink snakes pretty soon,” said
Breezy.</p>

<p>“Are you his keeper?” asked Baggs.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t been appointed yet,” said Breezy
calmly. “But he’s goin’ to need one if he keeps
drinkin’.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s his business.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” Breezy grinned widely. “You ain’t
sick, are yuh, Amos? I seen yore buggy horse when
yuh came in. You must ’a’ been in a hurry. Out
at the Box S, wasn’t yuh?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your damn business.”</p>

<p>“Coil up and bite yourself,” advised Breezy, and
walked away.</p>

<p>It was after banking hours, and Breezy found
Lester Johnson, the bookkeeper of the bank, at the
office talking with the sheriff about Charley Prentice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” said Johnson. “I
hate to notify the directors, but something must be
done. Prentice has been drunk all the week. Keeps
a bottle in the washroom. I can’t understand him,
and he can’t understand anything.”</p>

<p>“I reckon the directors ort to know about it,”
said the sheriff. “A man in his condition ain’t
responsible. I’ll go and have a talk with him, before
yuh do anythin’, Johnson.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be fine, sheriff.”</p>

<p>Later that afternoon the sheriff went out to
Prentice’s home, but Prentice was asleep, doubled
up on the couch in the living-room, fully dressed,
badly in need of a shave and a haircut.</p>

<p>“What do yuh reckon is the matter with him?”
the sheriff asked the Indian woman.</p>

<p>“Drunk.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy. But why is he drinkin’?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” heavily. “Mebbe scared. Keep
close to gun.”</p>

<p>“Scared, eh? What’s he—oh, yeah.”</p>

<p>It suddenly dawned on the sheriff that Prentice
was afraid of Len Ayres. Prentice’s evidence had
been instrumental in sending Len to prison, and a
short time later he had married Mrs. Ayres. And
now he was drinking himself blind through a fear
that Len would do him bodily injury.</p>

<p>“Well, yuh can’t beat that,” he said aloud.
“Yellow pup.”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” said the squaw, which absolved her
of everything.</p>

<p>The sheriff went back and dropped in at the
Oasis, where he met Harry Cole. Charley Prentice
being uppermost in his mind, he told Cole that he
had discovered why Prentice was drinking so heavily.
Cole was interested.</p>

<p>“Prentice is yellow,” declared the sheriff. “I
don’t think Len would ever hurt him, do you?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” said the gambler thoughtfully.
“You think Prentice is yellow, Ben?”</p>

<p>“A streak up his back as wide as this street. His
cook says he’s stayin’ close to a gun. That means
he’s packin’ one, Harry. Johnson will prob’ly
notify the directors and Charley will lose his job.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t notified ’em yet, has he?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But he’ll have to pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>The mail had arrived a few minutes before the
sheriff left the Oasis, so he sauntered over to the
little post office, where there was usually a knot of
men, waiting for distribution. Amos Baggs was
there, but he looked so sour that the sheriff did not
talk with him.</p>

<p>Baggs was one of the first to get his mail, and
the sheriff idly watched him open an envelope and
scan the contents. A blank stare overspread the
face of the lawyer, succeeded by a sag of astonishment.
He blinked rapidly several times, shut his
teeth with a determined snap, and walked out,
striking his shoulder against the side of the door
as he made his rather blind exit.</p>

<p>“I’ll betcha that’s bad news,” said the sheriff to
himself, as he headed for the little window, where
the postmaster handed out the mail.</p>

<p>But the sheriff didn’t know half how bad it was.
Amos went back to his office and flopped down in
his chair, limp as a rag. He stared blindly at the
wall for several minutes, before he took out that
letter and looked it over again. It was from San
Francisco, and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='ni'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Baggs</span>,—More
tough luck and a scheme
gone wrong. I’m in a hospital with a broken arm
and some smashed ribs, but that is only part of
it. The girl who was to work with you on that
deal was instantly killed in the same accident.
Sorry I couldn’t notify you sooner, but I’ve been
in bad shape. Will write you more about it later.</p>

<div style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Sincerely,</div>
<div style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Jack Pollock</span>.</div>
<div>“P.S.—Tell Harry about it.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Baggs crumpled the letter in his hand, scratched
a match and applied it to the paper, after which he
placed the paper on top of a cuspidor and watched
it fade to writhing ashes.</p>

<p>His face was pale, and in his eyes was a queer
expression of wonderment. Absently he picked up
his pipe and lighted a match, but the pipe would
not draw, and with a bitter curse he threw it across
the room.</p>

<p>Finally he surged to his feet, stood for a moment,
as though undecided, but finally locked his office
and went across the street to the Oasis Saloon.</p>

<h2 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII: VISITORS</h2>

<p>Manzanita County was not heavily populated, nor
were there many towns, which possibly accounted
for the fact that Lobo Wells was the county seat.
Lobo Wells was really the head of the valley, at the
north end, being situated near the mouth of Manzanita
River, and almost against the hills. Manzanita
River promised much, near its source, but as it
flowed farther south the desert sands were too much
for its existence, and it finally ceased to be a stream
less than twenty miles south of Lobo Wells.</p>

<p>Fifteen miles due south of Lobo Wells was the
town of Kernwood City on the bank of the fast
fading stream, an outfitting place for a few scattering
cattle ranches in that vicinity.</p>

<p>On the stage road to Kernwood City, below Lobo
Wells, was the OK ranch, owned by Oscar Knight.
Three miles west of Lobo Wells was the JP ranch,
owned by “Silver” Prescott, the biggest ranch in
the Manzanita country, while to the east, almost
against the Broken Hills, was the Box S. Between
the JP and the OK was the little Circle A, which
had been owned by Len Ayres, but which his wife
had sold to the JP. It was only a JP line camp now.</p>

<p>The Broken Hills were well named. Jagged
cañons, towering, vermilion cliffs; a world on edge
and on end, where still remained evidences of the
cliff dwellers. Ten miles east of Lobo Wells was
the Devil’s Punch Bowl, a miniature Grand Cañon,
without inlet or outlet, almost round in contour.</p>

<p>It was the morning after Amos Baggs had received
the letter from Jack Pollock. Harry Cole, ex-sheriff,
now boss gambler of Lobo Wells, came down the
stairs of the hotel and paused at the little counter
to exchange a few words with the hotel-keeper, as
was his custom, before going to breakfast.</p>

<p>Harry Cole had been a hard-riding cowpuncher
before his election as sheriff, but his county office
and his present occupation had smoothed off some
of the rough edges and his huge frame was carrying
extra weight. Perhaps liquor had something to do
with it. Cole was not an early riser, because he did
not retire early. He exchanged a few words with the
man behind the desk, and his eyes idly roved over
the dog-eared register, which usually remained open
at the same page for weeks at a time. But this
morning there were two strange names entered in
a scrawling hand: H. Hartley and D. Stevens.</p>

<p>“Couple o’ cowpunchers,” explained the proprietor.
“Got in late last night. Said they rode in
from Kernwood.”</p>

<p>Harry Cole smoothed his moustache and lighted a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“Train just got in,” said the proprietor, apropos
of nothing whatever.</p>

<p>“I heard it whistle,” nodded Harry. He flung a
match in the cuspidor, brushed off his fancy vest
and walked to the doorway, where he stopped.</p>

<p>A man was coming up that side of the street,
carrying a small valise, and Cole recognised him as
John T. Grant, president of the Lobo Wells Bank,
who lived in Randall, about fifty miles south-east
of Lobo Wells. Grant was nearing sixty years of
age, a kindly appearing man, with snow-white hair
and a slight limp.</p>

<p>For years he had been in active charge of the
Lobo Wells Bank, but for over six months he had
transferred most of the work to Charley Prentice,
while he conducted the business of the Randall
Bank, owned by the same group of stockholders.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Grant,” said Cole pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, good-morning, Mr. Cole.”</p>

<p>The banker switched the valise to his left hand,
while he shook hands with the big gambler.</p>

<p>“Yo’re quite a stranger around here,” laughed
Cole.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>The banker sighed deeply and looked around.</p>

<p>“I came rather suddenly,” he said confidentially.
“Perhaps you are in a position to give me a few
facts regarding Charley Prentice.”</p>

<p>Harry Cole studied the face of the old banker
curiously, wondering who had told him about
Prentice.</p>

<p>“I have been informed,” said the banker sadly,
“that Charley is drinking heavily and neglecting
his work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anythin’ about the work,” said Cole.</p>

<p>“But you do know he is drinking?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t reckon it’s any secret, Mr. Grant.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’m very sorry, because I had
implicit confidence in Charley Prentice. Do you
know of any reason why he should suddenly take
to drink, Mr. Cole?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>The banker walked on and entered the bank.
Charley Prentice was seated at his desk in a dejected
attitude, and looked up at the banker through
bloodshot eyes. He needed a shave and a haircut,
and his collar was soiled, his necktie askew.</p>

<p>“Well, Charley,” said the banker coldly.</p>

<p>Prentice got to his feet, a crooked grin on his lips.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t looking for you to-day, Mr. Grant,” he
mumbled.</p>

<p>“I suspected as much,” Grant said, dryly. He
glanced around the bank, but no one was there,
except Johnson, the bookkeeper, who was busy
at his work. Prentice tried to straighten his tie,
to adjust himself generally.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Charley,” said the old man slowly.
“We’ve had some bad reports on you lately. At
first I didn’t believe it, but when the report came
again, I felt obliged to come and see for myself.
I’d have staked anything on you, Charley.”</p>

<p>Charley Prentice’s face twisted foolishly.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s wrong?” he asked thickly.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk right now, Charley; unfit for
work. Go home and sober up.”</p>

<p>“You mean—I’m fired?”</p>

<p>“That is what it amounts to, Charley. I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p>Charley Prentice took a deep breath and looked
around. Perhaps he was a trifle sorry too, but he
was also mad. He shoved his hands deep in his
pockets as he stood on unsteady legs.</p>

<p>“Fired, eh? That’s fine! After all, I’ve—who
reported me? Who told you I was drunk, eh?”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” said Grant mildly. “It
doesn’t seem to be any secret around here.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t, eh? I’ll tell you who reported me—Len
Ayres. He’s the one. By God, he said he’d
get me. Well, he got me, didn’t he? Ha, ha, ha, ha!
That’s fine. But I’ll fix him. I’ll show him if he
can come back here and—well, well! So you
believed him, eh? You took his word for things.
He said I was drunk, and you believed him. Came
sneaking in to find out, eh? Well, I’m not worrying
about the job.”</p>

<p>“Charley, you better go home and sober up.”</p>

<p>“Sober? I tell you, I’m as sober as a judge!
Look at me.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble—I can see you, Charley.”</p>

<p>Charley shrugged his shoulders and walked out,
but he didn’t go to his home—he went to the Oasis.
The old banker sat down at his desk and lit a cigar
with trembling fingers. Lester Johnson, the bookkeeper,
came over to him and shook hands.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too, Mr. Grant,” he said. “It was
rather hard for me to send you those reports.”</p>

<p>“I understand. Is Len Ayres back here in Lobo
Wells?”</p>

<p>“I hear he is, Mr. Grant. I don’t know him, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Charley Prentice married his wife after Len was
sent to the penitentiary for robbing this bank.”</p>

<p>“I have heard the story.”</p>

<p>“Ayres is a bad man, Johnson—a gunman.”</p>

<p>“Charley Prentice was taking a chance, don’t
you think?” Johnson inquired.</p>

<p>“I suppose he was. Still, five years is a long time,
and the woman was pretty. I understand that she
left everything to Charley—everything she took
from Len Ayres. The court awarded her everything
in the divorce.”</p>

<p>“Broke Ayres, eh?”</p>

<p>“Financially. He’d be a hard man to break
physically.”</p>

<p>“I think Prentice is afraid of him, Mr. Grant.”</p>

<p>“That may be why he is drinking. I’m really
sorry about it.”</p>

<p>“I liked Prentice, Mr. Grant.”</p>

<p>“We all did; but business is business, Johnson.”</p>

<h2 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX: A RUINED RANCH</h2>

<p>That same day Nan rode with Len Ayres. Sailor
had a touch of rheumatism, which made riding a
painful pastime, so he stayed at the ranch.</p>

<p>By this time Nan had become accustomed to the
saddle, and was really enjoying the riding. Len had
never had much to say to her about himself or his
past, and most of his conversation consisted in
explaining the duties connected with running a
successful cattle ranch.</p>

<p>This particular day he was more quiet and
thoughtful than ever. They rode westward from
the Box S, crossed the railroad tracks and forded
the river between Lobo Wells and the OK ranch.
They followed the river for a short distance, but
swung west again along a small stream, until they
reached a tumbledown sort of a small cattle ranch.</p>

<p>They drew rein on a slope above the cluster of
small houses, which were deserted, and Len studied
them for a long time. Finally he turned to Nan, a
whimsical smile in his greenish-gray eyes.</p>

<p>“There’s a monument to busted hopes,” he said
slowly.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Len,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, that’s right; you wouldn’t,” he said
gravely. “I don’t reckon many folks around here
realise it. To them it’s just an old deserted ranch.
The range country is full of ’em, Nan. But this one
happened to have been mine—once. It was when I
took a step upward from bein’ just a cowboy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was this your ranch, Len?”</p>

<p>He nodded and began the manufacture of a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“It’s a line camp for the JP now. They own it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you sell out?”</p>

<p>He sighed as he scratched a match on the leg of
his batwing chaps and lighted his cigarette.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have much to say about it, Nan. The
court gave my wife a divorce and all the property.
She sold it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was too bad.”</p>

<p>“They call it justice, Nan. I had a nice start in
cattle and horses.”</p>

<p>“I have heard some of it. Whispering told me
part of it. She married a banker, didn’t she?”</p>

<p>“A bank cashier,” he nodded. “Quite a jump
from the wife of a wild cowboy. But she was
ambitious, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Whispering said that she was very pretty.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she was. She knew it. That ruined
her, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Knowing that she was pretty?”</p>

<p>“Shore,” Len smiled wistfully. “It spoiled her.
When a woman finds out she’s pretty, she’s like a
young man who finds out he’s a good shot. They’re
both goin’ to hurt somebody before they get through.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m not pretty, Len.”</p>

<p>He turned in his saddle and looked at her closely.</p>

<p>“No, you’re not pretty, Nan; but yo’re good-lookin’.
You’ve got good eyes, pretty teeth and red
hair. Some day, some feller is goin’ to think yo’re
beautiful, and he’ll tell yuh. But you’ve got plenty
sense, and yuh won’t break his heart, because yuh
know yuh ain’t beautiful.”</p>

<p>Nan flushed hotly under his diagnosis. No woman
cares to be told that she is not beautiful, even if
she knows that it is the painful truth.</p>

<p>“Don’t get mad at me, Nan,” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“I’m not mad, Len.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. I reckon I got kinda rough with
yuh, but when I look down at that place I kinda
lose faith in women and men. That’s where my
boy was born, Nan. I remember that night so well.
I rode for the doctor to Lobo Wells and got him out
of bed. He wanted to hitch up his buggy horse,
but I made him pile on to my bronc, ’cause we
needed him bad.</p>

<p>“I said I’d hitch up his horse and foller behind.
I was so excited that I plumb forgot that I was
ridin’ a bad bronc, and about halfway between
here and the town I picked up the doctor. He was
scratchin’ matches in the middle of the road, tryin’
to find his medicine case. The bronc throwed him
flat. But we got there in time.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a fine little boy. I was the nurse.
The cattle business went flat with me. We didn’t
have no cook; so I done the cookin’ and the nursin’.
This is the first time I’ve seen the old place in over
five years, Nan—and it hurts. Memories hurt, even
if they’re happy memories. Mine are both kinds.”</p>

<p>“Was she happy with this other man, Len?”</p>

<p>“<i>Quién sabe?</i> I hope she was, Nan. Everybody
is entitled to happiness. Accordin’ to my viewpoint,
she didn’t play square. She wasn’t happy nor
satisfied for a long time. Nan, a woman has got to
love a man to live with him in the range country.
Not only that, but she’s got to sacrifice a lot. Girls
who are born to it get along the best. They don’t
know anythin’ else.”</p>

<p>“It is a lonesome life,” said Nan slowly. “But
I think I could learn to love it, Len. The city seems
so narrow beside this country. I could understand
hate in a city, but not out here.”</p>

<p>“There will always be hate, as long as men live,
Nan.”</p>

<p>“Did you love your wife, Len?”</p>

<p>He looked queerly at her, turned away and
rubbed the palm of his right hand on his saddle-horn.</p>

<p>“I admired her, Nan. Mebbe I loved her. I
loved my baby. She said I loved the baby more
than I did her. Women get queer notions. Do you
get queer notions, Nan?”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. That was a foolish question.
Didja ever have a sweetheart, Nan?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I have,” laughed Nan.</p>

<p>“Didja love him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I did, Len.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. My wife used to tell about the sweethearts
she had. I reckon she kept quite a tally.
But she said she never loved one, until she met me.
If that was the case, God was mighty good to them
other boys.”</p>

<p>“Did she sell everything you owned, Len?”</p>

<p>“Shore. I had a house in town, too. Wasn’t
worth much, but she sold it. She took what money
I had in the bank. Whisperin’ says she wasn’t satisfied
with what she got. There was another bank
roll, and she thought it was where she could get it,
but it wasn’t in sight. Baggs, yore lawyer, wrote
me a letter, askin’ where it was. I reckon she hired
him to write the letter.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t tell him, did you, Len?”</p>

<p>Len smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, Nan. I told him where he could
go, but he didn’t take my advice. Queer jigger, that
Baggs person.”</p>

<p>“Has he a good reputation, Len?”</p>

<p>He looked at her queerly.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Just curiosity, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m prejudiced, Nan. Yuh see, he
sent me to the penitentiary. The evidence wasn’t so
awful. They found my hat in the bank, after a
robbery. Kinda foolish for a man to leave his hat,
after robbin’ a bank, wasn’t it?” He smiled wryly
at her, as he eased himself in his saddle.</p>

<p>“But Baggs is a bitter devil,” he continued. “He
said a lot of dirty things about me durin’ that trial,
and he made the jury believe ’em. I didn’t have any
friends on that jury, Nan; Baggs saw to that, and
Charley Prentice was the star witness. He swore he
recognised me, and the judge sent me up for five
years.”</p>

<p>“Why did you come back here, Len?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“With all the bitter memories and the things
against you.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, his greenish-gray eyes half-closed
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I came back to dig up the money they
say I hid.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I asked that question, Len.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it don’t matter, Nan. Everybody wonders,
I reckon. Well,” he picked up his reins, “I suppose
I’ll dig it up some day. Hope to. Right now, it
don’t look promisin’, but yuh never can tell.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go down and look at the
old place, Len?”</p>

<p>He shook his head quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Whisperin’ told me that they
tore up all the floors and dug all around, lookin’
for my cache. I s’pose every cowpuncher in this
country has hunted for my buried treasure in the
last five years. They can dig for five more, and
never find it, Nan. Well, we might as well start back
home.”</p>

<p>“All right, Len. Do you know, I was just wondering
why Baggs asked me to make you foreman
of the Box S, when he was so bitter toward you
before.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he felt sorry for me,” smiled Len.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” doubtfully. “I wouldn’t trust him
too far.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t? Well, I guess that’s right. Yuh
see, I don’t trust anybody, Nan.”</p>

<p>“You’d trust me, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>He turned and looked squarely at her for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I’ll tell yuh about it sometime,” he replied
enigmatically, and they rode slowly back toward the
river.</p>

<p>Len’s reply worried Nan. Did he know she was
an impostor, she wondered? She knew that Len
had been very close to old Harmony Singer. Whispering
had told her about the friendship between
these two men for years, and that Harmony had
looked upon Len almost as a son. She wondered
what it was behind those greenish-gray eyes that
caused Len to look so queerly at her at times.</p>

<p>If there had been any other claimants to the
Box S Nan would have slipped quietly out of the
country, but Whispering had told her that she was
the only living relative of Harmony Singer, as far
as he knew. Some one had to own the ranch.</p>

<p>She was afraid of Amos Baggs, but she did not
know what his game was. And why did he ask her
to keep Len Ayres, she wondered? Was Len in on
the deal in some way? She had no one to talk
with; no one to confide in. It was just a case of
going ahead day by day, waiting to see what might
develop, at least until the will had been probated.</p>

<p>Nothing more had been said about the cheque
which Baggs had asked her to sign, but as they rode
in at the Box S Len turned to her and said:</p>

<p>“Baggs is probably sore about yuh not signin’
that cheque for him, Nan; but you stick to it.
After the will is probated, it’ll be all right. Stick
as close to the law as yuh can—it’s the safest thing
to do.”</p>

<p>“He can’t make me sign it,” smiled Nan, and
Len looked sharply at her for a moment.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t reckon he can. Anyway, his price
is pretty steep for just notifyin’ yuh. I suppose he
got paid as he went along, and never ran any bills.
But don’tcha worry about Baggs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not worrying about him, Len. I’d
rather take your advice than his.”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Len, “I wouldn’t go so far as
that, if I was you, Nan. He knows a lot about the
workings of the law, while about all I know is the
effects of it.”</p>

<p>Nan slipped to the ground and handed her reins
to Len. “You shouldn’t remind yourself of that
all the time, Len,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to,” he told her seriously. “Why, if
I didn’t remind myself all the time of them five
years, I’d go out and—and prob’ly get sent back
again. Nan, don’t never do anythin’ that might
send yuh to jail.”</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and started toward the stable
with the two horses, leaving Nan rather breathless,
looking after him. Came the soft drumming of the
old triangle beside the kitchen door, and she turned
to see Whispering grinning at her.</p>

<p>“Supper time, boss,” he said, his red face beaming
like a full moon. “Amos Baggs came out to see yuh
to-day, and me and Sailor shore sent him back home
talkin’ to himself. First time I ever seen Amos
Baggs with a skinful of liquor. Oh, he wasn’t
drunk, but he had plenty. He was jist a mongrel
when he showed up here, but me and Sailor shore
sent him home with a pedigree.”</p>

<p>“Did he say what he wanted?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Never had no chance, ma’am. We didn’t listen—we
talked. You hop into yore other clothes quick,
’cause them biscuits are due to rise out of the oven
right now. Sailor felt so good over his talk with
Baggs that he cut me plenty good wood for once
in his rheumatic existence.”</p>

<p>“Was Mr. Baggs angry?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” grinned Whispering. “But ’f he
wasn’t, he’s shore deaf as hell or got a wonderful
disposition.”</p>

<h2 id='chX'>CHAPTER X: STRANGERS IN LOBO WELLS</h2>

<p>“Mister, do you know how to fly kites?”</p>

<p>One “Hashknife” Hartley, newcomer, sitting on
the wooden sidewalk in front of the Lobo Wells
Hotel, lazily turned his head and looked at little
Larry Ayres, half hidden by a huge home-made
kite, from which a rag and string tail dragged
several feet behind. The boy’s face was very serious
as he questioned the lean, lanky stranger, whose gray
eyes were hidden beneath the wide brim of his
sombrero. “I can’t git it started,” confessed the
boy helplessly.</p>

<p>Hashknife’s lips parted in a wide, lazy grin.</p>

<p>“Pretty big kite for a small boy, don’tcha think,
buddy?”</p>

<p>“I wanted her big. My name’s Larry, and I’ve
got plenty of string.”</p>

<p>“Then yo’re all right—except for a start. Make
it yourself?”</p>

<p>“Me and Minnie. Minnie’s Injun, and she don’t
know beans about a kite. But she made the paste
and gave me a nickel for string. What I need is
help, right now.”</p>

<p>“That’s a common need,” grinned Hashknife, as
he got up from his seat. “I reckon yore need is as
worthy as most; so we’ll fly the kite, Larry. What’s
the rest of yore name?”</p>

<p>“There’s some argument about that,” said Larry
seriously, grasping the kite in both hands and
kicking the tail away from his feet. “We’ll go out
on the flat near my house, where we can get a
run at it.” He led the way, while the lanky cowboy
followed him, grinning a little. There was plenty
of open country, but of wind there was none, and
after a few ineffectual trials they decided that
kite-flying was a failure.</p>

<p>“Yuh need wind,” explained Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s right,” agreed Larry. “We don’t
get much wind about here. What’s yore name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Hartley, Larry. Why did you say
there was an argument about yore name?”</p>

<p>“Because my real dad went to jail for a long time,
and my other dad was named Prentice. But my
name is Ayres, just the same. Do you know Len
Ayres? He was a bank robber—but he ain’t now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” nodded Hashknife thoughtfully.
“But yo’re still livin’ with yore other dad, ain’t
yuh?”</p>

<p>“I’m still stayin’ at his place. But he’s drunk.
He’s the cashier of the bank.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah—and he’s drunk, eh? Not so good
for a bank cashier, is it, Larry?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. He didn’t used to drink at all, but
now he’s drunk all the time. Me and Minnie keep
away from him, ’cause he swears at us. He’s got
a gun, too.”</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for trouble, eh?” smiled Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Minnie says he’s got trouble inside.
What does she mean by that?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t sick, is he, Larry?”</p>

<p>“He never had any doctor.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” thoughtfully. “Well, Larry, I reckon
the kite ain’t a success.”</p>

<p>“I guess we better wait for a wind, Mr. Hartley.”</p>

<p>Larry leaned the kite against a fence post and
walked back to the main street with Hashknife,
where they met Breezy Hill, the deputy sheriff.
Larry managed the introduction very well, and the
two men grinned at each other as they shook hands.</p>

<p>“We been tryin’ to fly a kite, Breezy,” explained
Larry.</p>

<p>Breezy grinned. “That’s shore fun. I ’member
once down in southern Kansas, when me and another
feller flew a kite. He made it out of half-inch hardwood
strips, covered it with rawhide, and hooked
on a hundred and fifty feet of half-inch rope. Then
I tied off on my saddle-horn and went straight into
the wind. I got my right arm broke and lost a
sixty-dollar saddle. Ho, ho, ho! They have <i>wind</i>
in Kansas!”</p>

<p>“I wish we had wind here,” sighed Larry.</p>

<p>“Well, I came here to git out of it,” laughed
Breezy.</p>

<p>They walked down towards the livery stable,
where Sleepy Stevens had gone to see that the
stableman had taken good care of their horses, and
found him near the wide front door. Hashknife
introduced him to Breezy. Sleepy Stevens was of
medium height, broad of shoulder, with rather a
blocky face, deeply lined with grin-wrinkles, and
with wide, innocent-appearing blue eyes.</p>

<p>The raiment of both Hashknife and Sleepy were
typical of the south-west ranges. Overalls tucked
in the tops of high-heeled boots, thin, faded shirts,
stringy vests, well-worn silk neckerchiefs and
Stetson hats, more or less weathered. Both men
wore holstered guns, sagging heavily from their
belts, which had seen so much service that they fitted
perfectly to the curve of hip and thigh.</p>

<p>There was nothing ornamental about their
garments. Neither man was inclined to ornaments,
and even their heavy Colt guns bore handmade
plain wood handles.</p>

<p>As the three men and the boy were talking, Amos
Baggs, driving a livery rig, turned his horse in
through the open doorway. The Lobo Wells lawyer’s
chin was set at a belligerent angle as his weak eyes
glanced at the group at the doorway, but he did
not speak until after he had turned the rig over to
the stable keeper and came back to the doorway.
He ignored Hashknife and Sleepy, speaking directly
to Breezy, who seemed rather amused.</p>

<p>“I’ve been out to the Box S,” he told Breezy.
“Went out to see Miss Singer, who is my client, as
you know, Hill. She wasn’t there, and I was ordered
off the place by Whispering Taylor and that other
old skunk, Sailor Jones. They threatened me with
a gun.”</p>

<p>“Ye-ah-ah?” drawled Breezy, evidently unimpressed.
“With a gun, eh? Yuh know,” reflectively,
“either one of them old jiggers will shoot.
They say that Sailor killed several men down in
the Panhandle, and Whisperin’ had so many notches
in his gun that it ruined the balance of it and he
had to throw it away.”</p>

<p>“That has nothing whatever to do with this
case,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Merely proves that you was wise in comin’
away, Baggs.”</p>

<p>“It may seem funny to you,” said Baggs angrily,
“but to me there was little humour in the situation.
I have a perfect right to visit that ranch. I handled
the affairs of Harmony Singer, and I have been
retained by Miss Singer in an advisory capacity.
I shall advise her to discharge those two men at
once, and I shall force the sheriff’s office to give me
protection. This is a fine state of affairs for a
civilised community.”</p>

<p>“You shore must have run into a hell of a lot of
grief out there,” grinned Breezy, “but I’d hate to
see the old fellers lose their jobs. They’d jist about
massacree yuh, Baggs. You couldn’t have ’em put
in jail for tellin’ yuh a few things, but if you get
’em fired—you better go on a vacation.”</p>

<p>“I refuse to be bullied!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. Anyway, you better tell yore troubles
to Ben Dillon, ’cause he’s the sheriff. I’m jist his
hired man, and I ain’t supposed to know anythin’.
He’d tell yuh his opinion.”</p>

<p>Baggs snorted angrily and went up the street,
mopping his almost bald head with a gaudy handkerchief,
while Breezy chuckled out loud.</p>

<p>“Ben’ll tell him his opinion all right. Ben hates
Baggs, and he likes them two old codgers.”</p>

<p>“Baggs is a lawyer, eh?” asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. Used to be prosecutin’ attorney of
this county. He done some lawin’ for old Harmony
Singer, who owned the Box S. Old Harmony up
and died from bein’ dragged by a horse, and he left
everythin’ to his niece. I guess she hired Baggs
to handle her lawin’.”</p>

<p>“Was the place worth much?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. The Box S is a good layout.”</p>

<p>“Is the girl runnin’ it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon she is, with the help of Len Ayres and
them two old jiggers that made Baggs so uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“Len Ayres is my father,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s right, Larry,” agreed Breezy. He
turned to Hashknife. “I’m gettin’ hungry, and I
hate to eat alone; will you boys join me?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we can eat,” grinned Hashknife, and
they walked up to a restaurant, where Larry left
them.</p>

<p>Breezy was rightly named. He loved to talk, and
during the hour he spent in the restaurant with
Hashknife and Sleepy, he gave them a résumé of
Lobo Wells for the past five years. He talked until
even the bland-faced Chinese waiter wondered what
it was all about, because cowboys usually bolted
their food and finished in haste.</p>

<p>“And nobody ever did find Len Ayres’s cache,
eh?” queried Hashknife.</p>

<p>“If they did, they never told anybody. Why,
even after Len’s wife married Prentice and sold
Len’s old ranch, they tore up the floors and dug all
around the place. I reckon they had an idea he
cached the money near home. He’s back again
now, and he’s the only one who knows where it is.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the sheriff is keepin’ a watch on
Ayres, eh?”</p>

<p>“He’d have a swell chance, Hartley,” Breezy
said.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s true. Not a chance in a million.”</p>

<p>“And Charley Prentice drank himself out of a
job since Len came back. Hardly ever took a drink
before. Now he’s lost his job,” the deputy added.</p>

<p>“Scared that Ayres might kill him for what he
done?”</p>

<p>“Looks thataway. Took to booze like a calf to
milk. Makes it tough on the kid. But at that, I’ll
betcha the kid would quit Prentice any time to go
with Len.”</p>

<p>Hashknife nodded. “And you say that Amos
Baggs was the prosecutor who sent Ayres to the
pen?”</p>

<p>“Shore was.”</p>

<p>“Who was the sheriff—the same one you work
for?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o. Harry Cole was sheriff then. He owns
the Oasis Saloon and Gamblin’ Palace. His term
ran out the followin’ year after Len went over the
road.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. And Prentice was cashier of the bank
when Len Ayres robbed it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Y’betcha. And then he turned around and
married the wife of the man who robbed him. Kinda
funny, eh?”</p>

<p>“Funny to us, I suppose,” said Hashknife slowly.
“Fate is a queer thing.”</p>

<p>“Are you one of them fellers who believes that
everythin’ is cut out for people?” Breezy asked.
“That it don’t make no difference how careful
yuh are, nor how wise yuh are?”</p>

<p>“Somethin’ like that,” nodded the tall cowboy.
“There’s a Big Book somewhere with it all written
down. On that book is the things yuh are to do
and how yuh finish. You can’t dodge it, Hill.”</p>

<p>“Yuh mean that yuh can’t help bein’ what yuh
are and doin’ what yuh do, Hartley?”</p>

<p>“You shore can’t.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m-m-m,” thoughtfully. “It seems to me
that when yuh feel thataway about life, yuh can
forgive folks for what they do.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s kinda human, Hartley. But from
what I’ve seen and heard in my life, yore lodge ain’t
got a hell of a big membership. Let’s go over and
meet Ben Dillon. He’s hawg-fat and he ain’t so
awful smart, but he’s human enough and lazy
enough to forgive anybody. If you boys are lookin’
for jobs, I’ll see Silver Prescott for yuh. He owns
the JP outfit, and he’s a good man.</p>

<p>“And there’s Oscar Knight’s OK outfit. He
don’t use so many men as Silver Jim does, but he’s
plumb white man. Of course, the Box S is out of
the question, unless Baggs manages to git them two
old men fired, which I hope he don’t. It wouldn’t
be the Box S without them two old terriers. Whisperin’
Taylor does the cookin’, while Sailor Jones
cuts the wood, does the horse wranglin’, and helps
with the ridin’. And there ain’t a minute when
they’re together that they don’t quarrel. But
lemme tell yuh this much—don’t pick on one of
’em when the other is in hearin’ distance.”</p>

<p>Hashknife and Sleepy laughed, as the three
walked across the street to the sheriff’s little office.</p>

<p>Ben Dillon did not prove as communicative as
Breezy Hill. While being good-natured and friendly,
Dillon was inclined to be just a little reserved with
strangers. Breezy explained that Hashknife and
Sleepy were looking for jobs with some outfit, which
seemed reasonable to the sheriff.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when Hashknife and
Sleepy got their first chance to see the notorious
Len Ayres. They were in the Oasis Saloon playing
a game of pool when Len came in. Breezy was in
the game and pointed Len out to them as he stopped
near the bar, looking the room over.</p>

<p>Hashknife was more interested in Charley Prentice,
although he did not know who Prentice was. The
ex-cashier was standing at the bar where he had
imbibed considerable whisky, and his extreme
nervousness had attracted Hashknife.</p>

<p>His eyes seemed dilated and he continually fussed
at his sleeves, rubbed his chin, and otherwise gave
evidence that his nerves were in a bad way. Hashknife
decided that this man was on the verge of
delirium tremens, and would bear watching. His
clothes were wrinkled, his collar dirty and he had
not shaved recently. He left the bar and came
down toward the pool table, walking rather unsteadily
and acting as though he didn’t know what
to do next. Hashknife was in the act of making a
shot, but lifted his cue and looked at Prentice, who
was so close that he interfered with the cue.</p>

<p>Hashknife was about to speak to him when he
noticed that Prentice was staring at Len Ayres,
who was watching a poker game. For the space of
possibly five seconds Prentice looked at Len Ayres,
and then, without any warning, slipped a hand in
his coat pocket, quickly drew out a heavy Colt
revolver, snapped back the hammer and pointed the
gun at Len’s back.</p>

<h2 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI: ATTEMPTED MURDER</h2>

<p>As quick as a flash Hashknife swung his billiard cue
in a short arc, struck Prentice’s right wrist a sharp
blow, knocking the gun out of his hand. But the
force of the blow also caused Prentice to jerk back
on the trigger, and the gun went off before it
clattered to the floor. The bullet drove into the
floor just short of the poker table.</p>

<p>Len Ayres whirled at the report of the gun, and
Hashknife saw as swift a piece of gun play as he
ever saw in his life. Len had whirled, drawn his gun
and was backing away, swinging the muzzle of his
gun menacingly, almost before the thud of the shot
had died away in the room.</p>

<p>But all he saw was Charley Prentice, clinging to
his right wrist with his left hand, the gun on the
floor at his feet, and Hashknife dangling a billiard
cue in his two hands.</p>

<p>The room was in an uproar in a moment. Harry
Cole stepped close to Prentice, grasping him by the
arm, while Prentice mumbled plaintively and tried
to draw away, but the big gambler yanked him
back, his eyes snapping.</p>

<p>“Yuh can put up yore gun, Len,” said Breezy
nervously. “I seen it all. Prentice tried to shoot
yuh in the back, but Hartley here smashed him
across the wrist with a pool cue. Mebbe I better
put the danged fool in jail.”</p>

<p>“Not on my account,” said Len.</p>

<p>“But he tried to murder yuh, Len. If Hartley⸺”</p>

<p>“If Len ain’t kickin’, where do you come in?”
interrupted Harry Cole. “Too much liquor. Bed is
the place for him—bed and a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” grunted Breezy. “Might handcuff
him at the same time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him,” said Cole, and led Prentice
out of the saloon.</p>

<p>Len holstered his gun and came slowly over to
Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Len, I want yuh to meet Hartley,” said Breezy.</p>

<p>“I want to meet him, Breezy,” Len said soberly,
as they shook hands. “And I want to thank Hartley
for what he done.”</p>

<p>“Yo’re welcome, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. I reckon he kinda had me foul.
I didn’t see him there, Breezy. Mebbe I wouldn’t
have noticed him, anyway. He ain’t the same man
he was when I left here.”</p>

<p>“He’s older, Len; and he’s been drinkin’ heavy.
Lost his job.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Fact. Old man Grant fired him.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, that’s kinda hard luck.”</p>

<p>Hashknife looked closely at Len Ayres, who
seemed genuinely sorry to hear that Prentice had
lost his position. Ayres might be a bad man, but
Hashknife decided that there was nothing petty
about the man. Breezy introduced him to Sleepy.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’m lucky you boys came to Lobo
Wells,” he said. “I’m shore indebted to yuh,
Hartley. Any time I can do anythin’ for yuh, just
yell loud enough for me to hear.”</p>

<p>“Yuh ain’t indebted to me,” grinned Hashknife.
“I’ve been watchin’ that feller for quite a while,
expectin’ any minute that he’d start trompin’ on
snakes. I don’t think he’s responsible for what he
done.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he knew what he was doin’,” said
Breezy.</p>

<p>“I reckon he did,” nodded Len. “But it’s all past
now. I wouldn’t get any satisfaction out of jailin’
him, Breezy. Yuh see,” he shifted his eyes to
Hashknife. “I know what it means to be behind
the bars.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got friends on both sides of ’em,” said
Hashknife. “I dunno which ones I prefer; possibly
the insiders.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen some pretty good men on both sides,”
agreed Len.</p>

<p>“Speakin’ of people yuh don’t like, Len,” said
Breezy, “we saw Amos Baggs to-day, after he was
out to the Box S. He shore was fit to be tied. Said
that Whisperin’ and Sailor ran him off the ranch.
Gee, he shore was boilin’.”</p>

<p>Len smiled thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I guess he would be. I didn’t know they ran
him off.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the way he’d put it, Len. Said he
was goin’ to have the lady boss fire both of ’em.”</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” The greenish-gray eyes hardened
for a moment. “Mebbe the lady will have somethin’
to say about it, Breezy.”</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ that myself. How do yuh like
her, Len?”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s all right, I reckon. Don’t know
anythin’ about the business, of course.” He smiled
suddenly. “Gives Whisperin’ and Sailor somethin’
to quarrel about. Sailor swears he don’t like her
and that he’ll quit the job the first time he gets a
chance. But I’d hate to be the person to say a
word against her where he could hear it.”</p>

<p>Harry Cole came back and walked up to Len.</p>

<p>“I took him home and had one of the boys get
a doctor,” he told Len. “Charley is in bad shape.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad, Harry; I hope he gets along
all right.”</p>

<p>Cole looked sharply at him, but walked away
without further conversation. Len held out his
hand to Hashknife, as he said:</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be goin’ back, but I want yuh to
know I appreciate what you did for me, Hartley.
Come out to the Box S.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” grinned Hashknife. “We’ll see yuh
later,” and then he turned back to the table and
picked up his cue.</p>

<h2 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII: FREE LANCES OF THE RANGE</h2>

<p>The next few days were quiet ones in Lobo Wells.
Hashknife and Sleepy met Silver Jim Prescott of
the JP ranch, but he had no jobs open. It was the
same with Oscar Knight, the little bow-legged owner
of the OK outfit. He sized both men up seriously
and told Hashknife frankly that he was sorry he
didn’t have a job for them.</p>

<p>But the pair did not seem worried about the
inability to secure work, and made no effort to
move farther down the valley, where there were
other cattle outfits. They spent much of their time
at the Oasis, playing pool or poker, and loafing
around the sheriff’s office, imbibing local colour and
gossip from Breezy, who never seemed to run out
of conversation.</p>

<p>Charley Prentice had narrowly succeeded in
evading an attack of delirium tremens, but was
now back at the liquor again. Hashknife had met
him several times, but Prentice did not recognise
him. Hashknife had been introduced to Amos
Baggs, who was also drinking more than was good
for him, which caused the Lobo Wells lawyer to
appear morose and grim.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this place,” decided Sleepy. “Nothin’
ever happens around here, Hashknife. Another week
in this town and I’ll start sproutin’ like a potato.”</p>

<p>Hashknife grinned slowly.</p>

<p>“It ain’t very fast, Sleepy. But ain’t it restful?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s shore restful.”</p>

<p>“All my life I’ve wished for a peaceful town.
This is it, Sleepy; Peaceful Town. Lobo Wells
sounds like a place where things might happen, but
she’s misnamed. Mebbe.”</p>

<p>“Why the mebbe, cowboy?”</p>

<p>“Who knows what’s under the surface? Consider
dynamite; it’s just a brown cylinder. Just about
as dangerous as a stick of wood, unless yuh monkey
with it. Never judge anythin’ by what yuh can
see, Sleepy. And for a change I’d suggest that me
and you ride out to the Box S.”</p>

<p>“Suits me. Anythin’ to get away from this
town.”</p>

<p>Whispering Taylor looked upon them with
suspicion until it dawned upon him that Hashknife
was the tall stranger who had prevented Charley
Prentice from shooting Len Ayres. Len had told
him about the incident.</p>

<p>“I’m Whisperin’ Taylor,” he told Hashknife.
“Len and Sailor are out in the hills some’eres
to-day. Git down and rest yore feet. I’m bakin’
some apple pies and there’ll be a-plenty for everybody.
Tie yore broncs in the stable and heave a
few oats into ’em.”</p>

<p>Nan, hearing voices, came out on the porch, and
Whispering managed to perform a sort of introduction,
after which he headed for the woodpile
in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Len told me about you,” smiled Nan. “I’m
glad you came out to see us.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” nodded Sleepy quickly. “Nice place
yuh got, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“It really is nice.”</p>

<p>“One of the nicest I ever seen,” seriously. “And
it’s kind of a novelty to find a woman runnin’ a
cow ranch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not running it—much. I leave that to
the men.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s the right thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you put up your horses and stay for
supper? Len and Sailor will be along pretty soon,
and I feel sure they would be sorry if you didn’t
stay.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made up <i>my</i> mind,” grinned Sleepy. “I’ll
stay.”</p>

<p>“I expected that,” said Hashknife seriously.
“Thank yuh, Miss Singer.”</p>

<p>“By golly, that’s a pretty girl,” declared Sleepy,
as they unsaddled their horses at the stable.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” said Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I’d tell a man!”</p>

<p>Hashknife chuckled softly. Sleepy felt the same
about every girl he met, and still he had never had
a girl he could call his own.</p>

<p>“What are you grinnin’ about?” asked Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Nothin’. Only I’ve heard that same thing
before, Sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not? I’m old enough to know what
I—aw, quit it! Just because yo’re girl-proof, yuh
don’t need to think I am.”</p>

<p>“I never thought yuh was, pardner. Go ahead.
This would be a great country to settle down in—and
sprout.”</p>

<p>“A feller could move, couldn’t he? Say, who
ever started this argument? My gosh, can’t I even
look at a girl?”</p>

<p>Hashknife chuckled loudly as he removed his
spurs and shook himself loose from his batwing
chaps.</p>

<p>“You’ve got my permission, pardner,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank yuh kindly, sir.”</p>

<p>They went back to the house and sat down on
the porch. Sleepy sat on the steps, hugging his
knees and watching Nan, as they talked. She had
absorbed considerable range knowledge from the
three men at the ranch and was able to discuss the
cattle business rather fluently for a beginner.</p>

<p>Hashknife mentioned different ranges and the
things they had seen in their wanderings from
Alberta to the Mexican border, and Nan seemed
greatly interested. “You must have done a lot
of wandering in your time,” she said.</p>

<p>“Quite a little,” agreed Hashknife thoughtfully.
“There’s a lot of trails behind us, and I hope there’s
a lot ahead. But yuh never can tell. That’s the
best of life—the uncertainty of the future. Always
gamblin’ with to-morrow; takin’ a chance. Do you
believe in takin’ chances, Miss Singer?”</p>

<p>Nan looked away quickly to escape those level
gray eyes of the tall, serious-faced cowboy. Did she
believe in taking chances? It seemed to her as
though this man knew.</p>

<p>“I suppose we all take chances,” she said softly,
not looking at him.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s true. When we get up in the
mornin’ we take chances.”</p>

<p>“Might choke on a aig,” drawled Sleepy, and
they all laughed.</p>

<p>“Do yuh like this life?” asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Nan quickly. “I have
never been so lonesome in my life, and yet I am
happier than I have ever been. Why, I haven’t
seen a woman since I’ve been here. I’ve been too
busy to go to Lobo Wells. I suppose there are
women in the town.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’ve seen some,” nodded Hashknife.
“But not the kind you’ve been used to seein’.
Paint, powder and styles don’t mean anythin’ to
’em. They’re hard-workin’ folks and they don’t
get much enjoyment out of life, but they’re human.
They won’t never say mean things about yuh, and
no matter who yuh are or what you’ve been, they’ll
shoot square with yuh. It ain’t a case of the survival
of the fittest out here, like it is in the city.
They don’t drive the weak ones to the outside of
the herd for the wolves to pull down. All they ask
is honesty, ma’am. Yore word is yore security.”</p>

<p>Nan drew a deep breath. All they asked was
honesty. And she wasn’t honest. But if she had
been honest she would still be tramping the streets,
looking for work, or working for a small wage and
living in a hall bedroom, cooking hamburger over
a gas jet.</p>

<p>“Everybody ain’t honest,” said Sleepy.</p>

<p>“If they was,” said Hashknife softly, “we’d
settle down, pardner.”</p>

<p>“And sprout,” added Sleepy.</p>

<p>Nan didn’t know what they meant, and it was
possibly just as well for her peace of mind that she
did not, although they knew nothing wrong of her.
To her they were but two drifting cowboys, looking
for work, but the back trails that Hashknife had
spoken about knew them for more than that.</p>

<p>Their partnership had begun when Henry Hartley,
a long, gangling cowboy, fairly fresh from the Milk
River country in Montana, drifted south and became
a rider for the brand from which he had later been
nicknamed.</p>

<p>And on this same ranch was Dave Stevens, nicknamed
Sleepy, a cowboy with an itching foot.
Together they rode the range of the Hashknife,
bunking together, sharing what they had, until the
horizon called them and they rode away together,
for ever ordained by Fate to keep on going, always
looking to see what was on the other side of the
hill.</p>

<p>Hashknife was the son of a range preacher, who
propounded the gospel of life in bunk-house or in
the open; teaching men how to live rather than
how to die; and Hashknife had absorbed much of
his philosophy as a foundation.</p>

<p>But through some kink Hashknife had been born
with a keenly analytical mind. He knew that every
effect must have a cause. His keen eyes registered
impressions of things that other men might overlook,
and as Sleepy had said: “He hears the grass
grow.”</p>

<p>It seemed as though fate threw them into troubled
places. Unconsciously they would blunder into a
range mystery, where Hashknife would be in his
element until it was cleared up. Again they would
accept an assignment from a cattle association to
clear up some trouble.</p>

<p>Sleepy analysed nothing. He was the man Friday,
supreme in his confidence in Hashknife’s ability,
following along, never knowing just when they
might strike the end of the trail; but always ready
to back Hashknife with a smoking gun or the weight
of his two hard fists.</p>

<p>It had not been a remunerative partnership.
They were poorer in pocket than the day they had
ridden away together. They did not ask for pay—did
not wait for it. The job was the thing.</p>

<p>And there had been many mighty hard jobs.
Death had ridden knee to knee with them many
times; struck at them from beside the bushy trail,
lashed out of the darkness, darted out at them from
a pall of powder smoke; but still it fell short.</p>

<p>Their life had made them confirmed fatalists.
Perhaps that and their sense of humour carried them
on. Neither of them was a split-second gunman. At
times they marvelled at their luck, which left them
unscathed while gunmen went down, leaving them
to carry on.</p>

<p>“Some day there won’t be no other side of the
hill,” Sleepy had predicted.</p>

<p>“It comes to every man,” Hashknife had agreed.
“But if we’re lucky we’ll get high enough up to
peek over the top.”</p>

<p>It was nearly supper time when Len and Sailor
rode in. Len seemed pleased to find Hashknife and
Sleepy there.</p>

<p>“I was wonderin’ if you’d left the country,” he
told them.</p>

<p>“We don’t move very fast,” grinned Hashknife.
“Miss Singer invited us to supper, so we decided
to stay.”</p>

<p>“I’m shore glad she did.”</p>

<p>Sailor was friendly enough, and even intimated to
Whispering that these two punchers never came
from any mail-order house, which was quite a lot
for Sailor to say about anybody.</p>

<p>After supper Len decided to ride to Lobo Wells
with them. They were out of tobacco at the ranch
and there were a few other small purchases to be
made. Nan shook hands with them and asked them
to come back soon. After they had ridden away
with Len, Nan said to Whispering:</p>

<p>“I like those two men, Whispering. I think the
tall one has the cleverest eyes I have ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get fooled on no cowpuncher,” advised
Sailor. “Clear eyes ain’t no bay-rom-eter on his
conscience. Most honest man I ever knowed was
plumb cross-eyed and had a sty on one of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yore idea of honesty,” said Whispering. “I
was kinda impressed by this tall one m’self.”</p>

<p>“Shore yuh would; didn’t he brag about yore
biscuits?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Whispering shook his head sadly.
“Sometimes I look at you, Sailor—and wonder. To
begin with, yore parents must ’a’ been easy-goin’
folks, or they’d ’a’ strangled yuh early in life. To
think of a man at yore advanced age havin’ lived
all this time!”</p>

<p>“Advanced age!” snorted Sailor. “My gosh,
to hear you talk you’d think I was sixty-five.”</p>

<p>“To hear <i>you</i> talk, I’d think yuh was a hundred,
Sailor.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” said Sailor ominously, “I’m goin’
to take you out and whip yuh, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-a-ah? I’ve heard that lotsa times.
You’ll probably wait until we both have to travel
in wheel-chairs, and then settle it with a race instead
of a fight.”</p>

<p>“What is all this argument about, anyway?”
choked Nan.</p>

<p>“He started it,” said Whispering.</p>

<p>“I did not,” bristled Sailor. “You said⸺”</p>

<p>“Yeah? I said what?”</p>

<p>They looked blankly at each other for several
moments.</p>

<p>“You better git me some wood, Sailor,” said
Whispering. “That last yuh got was better’n
usual, but the woodbox is empty.”</p>

<p>“Yeah—all right. It was some of that old corral
that me and Len tore down. It’s danged hard to
saw—but thasall right.”</p>

<h2 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII: SHOTS IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p>The three cowboys rode to Lobo Wells, where Len
made his few purchases, while Hashknife and Sleepy
stabled their horses, and they met again at the
Oasis. Johnny Harris and Archie Moon were in
from the JP ranch, and Len introduced them to
Hashknife and Sleepy.</p>

<p>The Oasis was busy that night. Harry Cole
nodded coldly to them, as he went past them and
entered his private room at the rear of the building.
Johnny and Archie wanted to play pool; so they
made it a three-handed game with Sleepy. After
taking one drink, Len said he was going back to the
ranch, and urged Hashknife to come out soon.</p>

<p>Breezy Hill dropped in for a few minutes, and
Hashknife went back to the office with him.</p>

<p>“Somebody said that Len was in town,” said
Breezy, after Hashknife had spoken about being
out at the Box S. “Charley Prentice was around
here early this evenin’, half drunk and half loco.
I dunno whether he’s got a gun or not, but a man in
his condition ain’t safe—not after what he tried to
do to Len the other night.”</p>

<p>“Fit to be locked up,” agreed Hashknife. “Is
he home now?”</p>

<p>“I think he is. I was up past his house a while
ago, but everything was quiet. I kinda worry about
that kid.”</p>

<p>And the kid, as Breezy termed him, was also
worried. He and Minnie, the squaw, stayed close
to the kitchen, while Prentice sprawled on a couch
in the little living-room, talking to himself at
intervals.</p>

<p>“We go ’way pretty soon,” decided Minnie.
“No good stay here. Worse all time.”</p>

<p>“But where’ll we go, Minnie?” asked Larry
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I dunno.”</p>

<p>Larry humped in a chair, resting his chin on his
two hands. “I guess we’ll git along,” he decided.
“Mebby I can git a job, Minnie.”</p>

<p>The fat, stoical face of the squaw did not change
expression, as she said: “Sure.”</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sharp knock on the front
door; a <i>rat, tat, tat</i>, as though some one struck the
door with a hard object. They heard Prentice growl
angrily and the couch creaked protestingly, as he
heaved himself upright. Larry stepped to the doorway
and watched Prentice pick up a gun from the
table and go lurching toward the door. He fumbled
for the knob, found it and yanked the door open.</p>

<p>Surging ahead he hooked the point of his left
shoulder against the side of the doorway and stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>“This is Ayres, you dirty dog!” snapped a
voice, and the next instant a gun spat fire twice
from beside the little porch, while the echoes rattled
back from the frame buildings across the street.
Came the crash of a body falling on the porch—silence.
Larry turned, white-faced, white-eyed, and
stared at the squaw, whose lips were tightly shut,
her eyes dilated a little.</p>

<p>Slowly she walked past Larry and went out to
the porch. Larry didn’t follow her, but his wide
eyes were glued on the front door, until she came
back, softly closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>“Plenty dead,” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“Dead?” whispered Larry, almost choking over
the word.</p>

<p>“Shot twice,” she said, nodding. “Die quick.”</p>

<p>“We—we ought to get the doctor,” faltered
Larry.</p>

<p>“Doctor no good now; better get sheriff.”</p>

<p>The sheriff! Larry blinked painfully. What
would he tell the sheriff? What could he tell the
sheriff? Tell him what they had heard? He wanted
to cry, but fought down the impulse. He came over
close to the squaw and she looked queerly at him.</p>

<p>“Minnie,” he said, “you didn’t hear anythin’,
didja?”</p>

<p>She stared at him for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“White man law,” she said.</p>

<p>“White man law, Minnie?”</p>

<p>“One man kill—one man hang.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Minnie, you mean they’d hang—him?”</p>

<p>“White man law hang him sure.”</p>

<p>“You would tell ’em, Minnie?”</p>

<p>She looked at him for several moments, her round
face as blank of expression as the wall behind her.
Finally she spoke.</p>

<p>“Minnie not white man; Minnie Injun.”</p>

<p>“You won’t tell, Minnie?”</p>

<p>“You go tell sheriff; Minnie hear nothing.”</p>

<p>Without another word he bolted from the rear
of the house and went running toward the street.
The sound of the shots had been heard by a number
of people, but as there had been no further disturbance
they decided that some cowboy was merely
working off some extra steam by shooting holes in
the sky.</p>

<p>Hashknife and Breezy did not hear the shots, and
were unprepared for the entrance of little Larry,
choking for breath, as he stumbled into the sheriff’s
office. Breathlessly he blurted out his story of the
killing.</p>

<p>“Yuh say he’s dead?” asked Breezy. “Sure he’s
dead, Larry?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t look,” panted Larry. “Minnie said he
was.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy, son,” advised Hashknife calmly.
“You say that somebody knocked on the door,
and when Prentice went to the door this somebody
shot him twice?”</p>

<p>Larry nodded quickly.</p>

<p>“Not a word spoken?” asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>“We—we didn’t hear nothin’.”</p>

<p>Ben Dillon was just coming from the Oasis as
they went past, and he joined them. He had heard
the two shots, but did not know just where they
had been fired.</p>

<p>They found Charley Prentice sprawled on the
little front porch, one arm dangling over the edge,
lying on top of his own revolver. They secured a
lamp from Minnie, placed it on a chair, so that the
body was illuminated, and Breezy went after the
doctor, who was county coroner. The sheriff questioned
Minnie, and her story, told in monosyllables,
was practically the same as Larry had told.</p>

<p>The coroner came and they examined the body.
He had been hit twice, and either bullet would have
killed him. No one offered any suggestions as to
who might have killed Prentice, except Breezy’s
remark: “I guess he was plumb scared to death that
Len⸺” And then Breezy ended his remark with,
“I didn’t think how that sounded.”</p>

<p>Hashknife was watching little Larry’s face in the
lamplight, and he saw the little fellow look sharply
at the squaw, who merely looked back at him with
a blank stare. The boy sighed deeply and moistened
his dry lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>They placed the body on a blanket and carried
it down to the doctor’s office. Hashknife looked back
towards the house, where the squaw stood in the
doorway, holding the lamp shoulder-high, her other
arm around the shoulders of little Larry.</p>

<h2 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV: AFTERMATH</h2>

<p>Lobo Wells was just a little shocked over the
killing of Charley Prentice. They did not call it
murder, although it was obvious that Prentice had
been murdered. Tongues did not wag in Lobo
Wells, but every one felt that there was just one
man in the country who might kill Charley Prentice.</p>

<p>The following morning Ben Dillon and Breezy
Hill rode out to the Box S. Len was saddling a
horse for Nan, and finished the job before coming
up to the house to meet them. Nan was talking to
them, but they had not told her about Prentice.</p>

<p>Len nodded and smiled as he tied her horse to the
porch.</p>

<p>“You boys must have started early, didn’t yuh?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Pretty early, Len. Charley Prentice was killed
last night.”</p>

<p>Len’s greenish-gray eyes opened a trifle wider as
he looked from Ben to Breezy.</p>

<p>“What killed him?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>“Couple of forty-fours, Len.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?” Len’s eyes did not waver. “What
time was this?”</p>

<p>“After you left town—a while after. Just what
time was it, Breezy?”</p>

<p>“I never looked,” confessed Breezy. “Yuh
remember when yuh left, Len? Well, me and
Hartley went over to the office, and it was ten or
fifteen minutes later when Larry came to tell us.”</p>

<p>“Did Larry see it?” asked Len.</p>

<p>“Nope. Somebody knocked on the door, and
when Prentice answered the knock, they shot him
dead on his own porch.”</p>

<p>Nan was staring at Len, and he turned his head
to look at her. “You were back early,” she said,
as though it might help him.</p>

<p>He smiled thinly.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I wasn’t very late,” and to the sheriff:
“Well, what do you think about it, Ben?”</p>

<p>The sheriff shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>“There’s no clue, Len. You didn’t see Charley
last night, did yuh?”</p>

<p>“He was at home when Len came in,” said Breezy
quickly.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see him,” said Len. “Shot with a
forty-four, eh? That’s the size of my gun, Ben.”</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” said the sheriff glumly. “Prob’ly
eight out of every ten punchers in this country pack
the same size.”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave yuh much to work on, Ben,” said
Len dryly.</p>

<p>“Not much. Well, I just wanted to tell yuh
about it.”</p>

<p>“To give me a chance for a getaway?”</p>

<p>Ben Dillon looked straight at him, as he said:</p>

<p>“Ain’t nobody accused yuh, have they, Len?”</p>

<p>“Not in words.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time to talk about a getaway when
they do.”</p>

<p>“Thank yuh, Ben. I’ll come in and see yuh.”</p>

<p>“All right. Pleased to have seen yuh again,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>They lifted their hats and rode away. Len leaned
a shoulder against the porch and watched them
disappear down the road. His lips were shut
tightly as he turned and looked at Nan.</p>

<p>“You didn’t do that, Len,” she said.</p>

<p>“That part of it don’t matter,” he said bitterly.
“It’s what people think. Sure, I killed him. I
might as well say I did, because I can’t prove I
didn’t.”</p>

<p>She came closer to him, searching his tensed
features.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t really kill him, Len; you
couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I, Nan?” He laughed shortly.
Suddenly he sobered, his eyes thoughtful. “I forgot
about the boy,” he said, as though to himself.
“It’s tough for him—mighty tough, Nan.” He
turned quickly. “Do yuh mind if we don’t ride
this mornin’? I’d like to go to town—to Lobo
Wells.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly all right, Len.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of yuh. I guess I better go now.”</p>

<p>He turned toward the stable.</p>

<p>“I want you to know that I believe in you, Len,”
she said.</p>

<p>He stopped, but did not look around.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty sweet of yuh, Nan—I’ll remember
it!”</p>

<p>He saddled his horse quickly, rode away to Lobo
Wells, arriving but a few minutes behind the sheriff
and deputy. He tied his horse to the Oasis hitchrack,
but did not enter the saloon. The sheriff had
gone to the doctor’s office, but Hashknife and
Breezy were in the sheriff’s office and saw Len
ride in.</p>

<p>“Whatcha suppose he wants?” grunted Breezy.
“Somethin’ must have struck him real sudden.”</p>

<p>They came to the doorway and watched Len
cross the street and stop in front of Amos Baggs’s
office, where Baggs was just coming out.</p>

<p>The Lobo Wells lawyer eyed Len suspiciously,
but there was no anger in Len’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I jist wanted to ask yuh a few questions,” said
Len. The lawyer nodded shortly, remembering that
Len had prevented Nan from signing that thousand-dollar
cheque.</p>

<p>“Charley Prentice never adopted my son, did
he, Baggs?”</p>

<p>Baggs’ face twisted thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“No-o-o,” he drawled. “No, he never adopted
him, Len.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ to prevent me from taking that boy,
is there?” asked Len.</p>

<p>Baggs walked to the edge of the sidewalk, spat
thoughtfully and turned to Len.</p>

<p>“Nothing legal.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ what, Baggs?”</p>

<p>“There still remains the moral aspect of the
thing.”</p>

<p>Len’s eyes hardened.</p>

<p>“Meanin’ that I ain’t fit to take him, Baggs?”</p>

<p>“In plain words: no, you are not, Ayres.”</p>

<p><i>Splat!</i></p>

<p>Len’s open right palm landed on the lawyer’s
left ear, with every ounce of his lithe body behind
it, and Mr. Baggs went sideways off the sidewalk,
landing on his shoulders in the dusty street.</p>

<p>For a moment Len looked down at him, rubbed
the hot palm of his hand on his thigh, and walked
on up the sidewalk, as though nothing had happened.
Baggs struggled to his feet, mouthing profanity,
swearing dire threats, while Breezy fairly
hugged Hashknife in the office door, chuckling with
unholy glee.</p>

<p>Baggs climbed back on the sidewalk, trying to
shake the dust off his clothes, shaking a fist at Len
between swipes at his garments. Then he turned
and came down toward the sheriff’s office, half
trotting in his haste. Breezy shoved Hashknife
back from the doorway and locked the door.</p>

<p>“Nobody home,” he grinned at Hashknife, who
nodded. Baggs tried the door, knocked loudly,
swore disgustedly, and went back to his office.</p>

<p>“Probably wants to swear out a warrant for
assault,” grinned Breezy, unlocking the door.
“Give him time to cool off, and he won’t feel so
bad about it. I wonder where Len went.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t in sight on the street, because he had
gone up to Prentice’s house and was knocking on
the door. Minnie came to answer the knock, and
behind her was little Larry. Len looked at the
expressionless face of the squaw and then at the
face of his son.</p>

<p>“I heard what happened last night,” he said
slowly, “so I—want yuh to come out to the ranch
with me, Larry.”</p>

<p>The boy’s face lighted up for just a flash—and
then he remembered. He came past the Indian
woman, came very close to his father, his hands
behind him, but did not look up.</p>

<p>“Don’tcha want to come with me, Larry?”
asked Len.</p>

<p>“I want to come, but I can’t,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why can’t yuh come, son?”</p>

<p>The boy took a deep breath, but he was game.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t done that—last night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Done what, Larry? Look up at me. Done
what?”</p>

<p>“What you done.”</p>

<p>Len looked at the squaw, whose eyes were fastened
on his face.</p>

<p>“We not tell,” she said firmly.</p>

<p>Len’s eyes shifted to the boy.</p>

<p>“Do you think I killed Prentice?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We won’t tell. Me and Minnie will never tell,
will we, Minnie?”</p>

<p>“Not by damn sight,” she replied inelegantly but
firmly.</p>

<p>Len turned slowly around and walked away, lips
compressed, his eyes staring at the ground. He
didn’t understand, except that they believed he had
killed Prentice and that they would not tell. The
boy had refused to go with him, because he had
killed a man. Len was dazed, wondering even when
he went back to the hitchrack and mounted his
horse. Hashknife and Sleepy were crossing the
street and spoke to him, but he did not see them.</p>

<p>He rode back to the ranch, stabled his horse and
sat down on the porch, trying to think. Nan came
out and tried to talk with him, but he would not
answer; so she sat down in a chair and waited for
him to come out of his coma.</p>

<p>It was probably ten minutes later before he lifted
his head and looked around. His eyes were bloodshot
and Nan had never seen him look so old and
tired. He tried to smile, but it was but a grimace.</p>

<p>“Nan,” he said slowly, “do you know how
many people there are in the world?”</p>

<p>“Millions and millions, Len.”</p>

<p>“Funny, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“What is funny about it, Len?”</p>

<p>“That out of all that millions of people, you are
the only one who—do you still believe I didn’t kill
Prentice?”</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t, Len.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine.”</p>

<p>He clasped his hands around his knees and looked
out across the Broken Hills.</p>

<p>“When I was in the penitentiary I used to long
for the hills and the old cow-towns, Nan. I dreamed
of ’em every night. There was the sunrise in the
cow-camp, with waddies saddlin’ cold broncs, the
camp cook and his big black pot of coffee. There
was the round-up. Hard-ridin’ days; wild nights,
when it was all over. The dances at the ranch-house.
I could lay there on my bunk and hear the fiddlers
and the caller. I could laze along through the hills,
where the wind riffled the tall grass, straddlin’ a
dream horse, and see the cattle lift their drippin’
jaws from the water-holes. Night after night I’ve
dreamed it all over, waitin’ for the day when I’d
be free to come back to it all. But it ain’t like my
dreams, Nan. I thought I was bad off in the pen,
but I—I wish I’d stayed.”</p>

<p>“You wish you hadn’t come back, Len?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I reckon I’ve lost faith in folks—all of
’em.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t lost faith in me, Len.”</p>

<p>He looked closely at her for several moments, as
he got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Mebby I’ll tell yuh about it sometime,” he said.</p>

<p>It was the same enigmatic answer he had given
her before, as he walked down to the corral, where
Sailor had just ridden in. Nan closed her eyes and
tried to think what Len had meant. What had
happened to him in town to cause him to come back
in this frame of mind, she wondered?</p>

<p>He talked with Sailor for a while, but did not
come back to the house with him. He sat down on
a box beside the corral fence, giving no sign of life
other than an occasional puff of cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>Nan heard Whispering and Sailor arguing about
it in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“He ain’t drunk,” declared Whispering. “Yo’re
crazy.”</p>

<p>“Well, he acts drunk. Look at his eyes, will
yuh?”</p>

<p>“Aw, he wasn’t in town long enough to git drunk.
Go and git me some wood, Sailor.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he ain’t drunk, whatsa matter with
him?”</p>

<p>“Prob’ly bilious.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s reasonable; yore cookin’ would do
that.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t biliousness—that’s yore danged disposition.
Nothin’ short of a pistol whippin’ will ever
cure that.”</p>

<p>“Thasso? Mebby you think you can cure me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want yuh cured, you old squint-eyed
porkypine. Go git me that wood and stop arguin’.
You make me sick.”</p>

<h2 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV: AN UNKNOWN BUSHWHACKER</h2>

<p>The inquest frightened little Larry. He didn’t
know what it was all about, but he managed to tell
the same story he had told Hashknife and Breezy.
Minnie’s story was the same. There was no evidence
to show who had fired the fatal shots; so the jury
brought in the usual verdict.</p>

<p>Amos Baggs came to see the sheriff following the
inquest, and complained against Len Ayres for
knocking him down the previous afternoon. Hashknife
and Sleepy were with the sheriff when Baggs
called.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that yo’re a grown man, Baggs,”
said the fat sheriff. “If anythin’, yo’re bigger than
Ayres.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m going to fight him?” demanded
Baggs.</p>

<p>“Well, yuh didn’t; so what can yuh do about
it?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m going to let him batter me
around?”</p>

<p>“Say, what do yuh think this is—a guessin’
contest, Baggs? What do I know about what
you’ll do and what yuh won’t do? Yuh wasn’t
aimin’ to have Len arrested for slappin’ yuh, was
yuh?”</p>

<p>“It was plain assault.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-a-ah, I s’pose it was; very plain. But
it ain’t up to me, Baggs. Get the judge to swear
out a warrant and I’ll serve it.”</p>

<p>Baggs was mad. He even glared at Hashknife,
who grinned at him openly. He walked to the door,
but turned to fire a parting shot:</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know who killed Charley
Prentice.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the sheriff wearily, “I didn’t do it,
because I’m the sheriff; and you didn’t because
you ain’t got the nerve.”</p>

<p>“That’s supposed to be a smart answer, isn’t it,
Dillon?”</p>

<p>“It’s the right answer to a foolish question,
Baggs.”</p>

<p>After Baggs had left the office, the sheriff declared:
“I don’t like that feller.”</p>

<p>“I guess he knows it,” grinned Hashknife.
“Wasn’t he the prosecutor who sent Ayres to the
pen?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, and he shore piled it on a-plenty. I
thought Len would kill him when he came back,
but I guess the pen takes all the killin’ ideas out of
a man. Nobody ever wants to go back.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Ayres really cached a lot of that
money he stole?”</p>

<p>The sheriff laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“I suppose every man in this county has asked
himself that same question, Hartley. Nobody but
Len could prove it. They say he was the one who
pulled the jobs, and he must have done somethin’
with the money. I think some folks had a sneakin’
suspicion that his wife knew where it was. But I
don’t think she did.”</p>

<p>“Was she pretty?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, y’betcha. Prettiest woman around here.”</p>

<p>“How soon did she marry Prentice after Len was
convicted?”</p>

<p>“Well, she got her divorce right away, and they
was married inside of six months.”</p>

<p>“She must have known him before Len was
sent up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. They’d been friends a long time.”</p>

<p>“Len and Prentice?”</p>

<p>“Prentice and the woman. Oh, I suppose him
and Len was good enough friends.”</p>

<p>“You wasn’t sheriff at that time, was yuh?”</p>

<p>“Nope. Harry Cole was the sheriff. Afterward
he bought out the Oasis Saloon. He’s made good
money over there.”</p>

<p>“What’ll become of the kid now?”</p>

<p>“Larry? I dunno, Hartley; never thought
about him. Say, that is somethin’ to think about.
Mebbe Len wants him. I’ll have to find out about
that right away, because I don’t suppose Prentice
left anythin’. Anyway, it probably can’t be touched
until the estate is settled up. I’ll talk with Grant,
at the bank, and see what he knows about Prentice’s
finances.”</p>

<p>The next day they buried Charley Prentice in
the little cemetery on the slope behind the town.
The countryside came to pay homage to a man they
had known as a good citizen. His sudden fall from
grace meant nothing against a good record. Hashknife
and Sleepy did not intend to go to the funeral,
although the sheriff asked them to go with him.</p>

<p>They were sitting in front of a store, as the funeral
came down a short side street and wended its way
out of town. It was not over a quarter of a mile
to the cemetery. The wagons, buckboards and
riders were still turning the corner on to the main
street, when Len Ayres rode in. He drew up in
front of the Oasis and watched the procession.</p>

<p>And as the last vehicle turned the corner, he
spurred his horse and fell in behind.</p>

<p>“Can yuh imagine that?” snorted Sleepy. “He’s
goin’ to the funeral!”</p>

<p>Hashknife looked seriously at Sleepy and got to
his feet.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll go along, pardner. C’mon.”</p>

<p>The cortege moved slowly, so they had no difficulty
in reaching the graveyard in time. Len tied his
horse to a fence and mixed in with the crowd around
the grave. Hashknife and Sleepy managed to get to
a vantage point where they could watch everything.
Little Larry was the sole mourner, but he was too
interested in the crowd to be much of a success.</p>

<p>They saw Len push his way in close to the grave,
where he stood all during the ceremony, paying no
attention to any one. In fact, he was the centre of
interest, although he seemed unconscious of it.
Amos Baggs stood across the grave from him, and
if his expression was any criterion of his feelings, he
was sorry that it wasn’t Len’s funeral.</p>

<p>Len stayed in the one spot until the crowd began
to disperse, when he went slowly back to his horse
and rode away. Breezy met Hashknife and Sleepy
at the fence, bursting for a chance to talk.</p>

<p>“Can yuh ee-magine that?” the deputy demanded.
“Stood right there and watched ’em
plant Charley! That’s cold nerve, Hartley.”</p>

<p>“Do yuh suppose he was merely tryin’ to show
his nerve?” asked Hashknife. “Yuh know it don’t
take nerve to attend the funeral of a man you’ve
never hurt in any way.”</p>

<p>Breezy tipped his hat over one eye as he scratched
his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yeah, there’s somethin’ in that, too. Lordy, it
shore gave the folks a shock. Amos Baggs almost
fell in the hole—and I reached for a shovel. It ain’t
right to say it, but I’ve always hankered for a
chance to pat him in the face with a shovel. He
makes me mad, jist to look at him. Wait till I git
my horse, and I’ll walk back with yuh.”</p>

<p>They found Larry at the sheriff’s office, talking
with Dillon, when they came back. The sheriff
was trying to find out whether any one had made
plans for the boy. He seemed just a little bewildered,
but grinned at Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I’m still waitin’ for the wind to come along,”
he said.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” grinned Hashknife. “When she
comes, we’ll shore fly that kite, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Y’betcha.”</p>

<p>“I had a talk with Grant,” said the sheriff, “and
as far as he knows, Prentice didn’t leave a dollar.
Gambled quite a lot, and the luck usually went
against him. I dunno what about this boy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll betcha I know,” grinned Breezy. “Larry
would like to go out to the Box S and live with his
dad.”</p>

<p>Larry looked earnestly at Breezy for several
moments, but finally shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yuh don’t?” Breezy was astonished.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to go out there,” he said.</p>

<p>“I guess I better go home to Minnie.”</p>

<p>He walked out of the office and Breezy whistled
softly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that funny? Why, the other day he was
shore strong for Len. I don’t savvy what changed
him so quick.”</p>

<p>“Was he very fond of Prentice?” asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he was,” answered the sheriff.
“I don’t believe Prentice cared much for him.
Yuh don’t suppose the kid thinks that Len killed
Prentice, do yuh? That might make him afraid
of Len. Somebody might have told him that Len
was the one who done the shootin’.”</p>

<p>“That would be a dirty trick,” said Hashknife
quickly.</p>

<p>“Dirty tricks have been done,” smiled Breezy.
“I wouldn’t put it past Amos Baggs.”</p>

<p>Nobody reproved Breezy for that statement. But
Hashknife wasn’t satisfied. He left the office and
made his way up to the Prentice home, where he
found Larry in the yard. “No wind yet,” said the
boy. “I reckon we won’t get any to-day.”</p>

<p>“Not much chance,” smiled Hashknife, leaning
on the fence. “I wanted to ask yuh a question,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“To ask me a question, Mr. Hartley?”</p>

<p>“Man to man, Larry.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Did somebody tell you that Len Ayres killed
Prentice?”</p>

<p>The boy blinked quickly and turned his head
away.</p>

<p>“Just man to man, Larry,” urged Hashknife
softly.</p>

<p>Larry shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nobody told me,” he said. “Not a soul, Mr.
Hartley.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t even hear anybody hint it?”</p>

<p>“Do they think he killed Mr. Prentice?”</p>

<p>“Who do you think killed him, Larry?” countered
Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who killed him.”</p>

<p>“And you never even heard anybody hint that
your father might have killed Prentice?”</p>

<p>After a moment of sober thought the boy shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they thought he did,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“Thank yuh for answerin’ my question, Larry.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, Mr. Hartley. I hope we get
some wind.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I shore hope so. So long, Larry.”</p>

<p>“So long, Mr. Hartley.”</p>

<p>Hashknife went away unsatisfied. There was
some reason why Larry did not want to go to Len;
and Hashknife would never be comfortable until he
had discovered who shot Charley Prentice—and
why. He felt that Len Ayres was perfectly capable
of killing a man, but he did not think that Ayres
would ever commit murder.</p>

<p>He talked it over that night with Sleepy, but his
grin-faced partner had no ideas on the subject,
except the local thought that Len had killed him.</p>

<p>“Some folks think he done the right thing,” said
Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Yuh can’t justify murder, Sleepy.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t tryin’ to. Anyway, it wasn’t my funeral.”</p>

<p>“Did Len strike you as a man who would call a
man to his door and kill him?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, Hashknife. Readin’ human bein’s is
like dopin’ out a race horse from a form-chart.
They never run the way they should. I’d hate to
think he would, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he
did. What’s yore opinion?”</p>

<p>“The key to the whole thing is this, Sleepy: find
the man who wanted to kill Prentice.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know that. But Prentice was well liked
by most everybody. He never hurt nobody—except
Len Ayres. Ask anybody and they’ll tell yuh the
same thing. I’ve talked with a lot of ’em.”</p>

<p>“That’s what made it easy for somebody else to
kill him, and get away with it, Sleepy.”</p>

<p>Sleepy laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Hashknife, yo’re funny. If you seen a man
shoot another man, you’d prove that somebody else
done it.”</p>

<p>“And get a confession from ’em, Sleepy.”</p>

<p>“And they’d be guilty. Go ahead, but don’t ask
me to think. All I’m good for is to burn powder,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t much to think about—yet.”</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned Sleepy, “yo’re young yet.”</p>

<p>The next day Whispering made out a grub list,
and Nan rode to town with him in a lumber-wagon.
She had talked things over with Len and he had
advised her to get some cheques at the bank to
pay for the grocery list.</p>

<p>“Even before the will is probated, they’ve got
to allow enough money to keep the ranch goin’,”
he told her. “It may not be exactly accordin’ to
law, but that won’t matter.”</p>

<p>Nan didn’t want to meet Amos Baggs. She hadn’t
seen him since she refused to sign the thousand-dollar
cheque for him. The Arizona sun had changed her
complexion to an olive tan, and she might easily be
mistaken for a native of the range.</p>

<p>They were obliged to cross the railroad tracks near
the little sun-baked depot, and as a train was
approaching, Whispering drew up the team some
distance away. The train did not tarry long at
Lobo Wells, and as it drew away Whispering whipped
up the team.</p>

<p>They jolted across the tracks and headed down
the main street. A man dressed in black, one arm
in a sling, was going down the wooden sidewalk
from the depot, carrying a valise in his free hand,
and as they came abreast of him, he turned his head
sufficiently for Nan to see his face.</p>

<p>For a moment she grasped the side of the seat to
steady herself, turning her head away quickly.
Her heart seemed to come up in her throat.</p>

<p>It was Jack Pollock, the San Francisco gambler!
Madge’s friend! He was the last man she had ever
expected to see again, and the last one she wished
to see. Her mind was in a whirl, as the team drew
up in front of the store. Whispering looked at her
and put his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter—too much sun?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I—I’m all right,” she said jerkily.</p>

<p>“Yo’re mighty white, ma’am. I’ll help yuh down
and git yuh in the shade. A derned old wagon is
the hottest place on earth, anyway. We’ll git some
water for yuh.”</p>

<p>She walked shakily into the store, where Whispering
secured a cup of cold water for her. The proprietor
of the store was solicitous, but helpless.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right now,” she said weakly.</p>

<p>“You set right here,” advised Whispering. “I’ll
go up to the bank and git them cheques, and I’ll
tell Grant about it. I know him well. You jist take
it easy. Give Jim Albers here yore grub list, and
he’ll fix it up while I’m away.”</p>

<p>Nan was more than thankful to Whispering. She
didn’t want to go out on the street. It was cool in
that dark corner of the store, and she wanted time
to think. What was Jack Pollock doing in Lobo
Wells, she wondered? Baggs had spoken about
him, and Nan realised that Pollock was the one
who was going to send Madge Allan to Lobo Wells
to take over the Box S property.</p>

<p>Had some one suspected that she was an impostor
and sent for Jack Pollock to prove the suspicion?
She was at the end of her rope, and she knew it.
A word from Pollock would prove who she was.</p>

<p>Whispering was coming back, grinning widely.</p>

<p>“Feel better? Got everythin’ fixed up. Grant
said he’d take a chance on yore cheque. Got some
pen and ink, Jim? How much does that total?”</p>

<p>Nan’s hand shook as she made out the cheque, but
the men did not notice it. They loaded the stuff in
the wagon and drove away. Nan did not draw a
full breath until they were out of town. The colour
came back to her cheeks and Whispering nodded
approvingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yuh look a lot better,” he told her. “Gosh,
yuh shore looked like you’d seen a ghost, when we
pulled up at the store. This sun does fry yuh
plenty.”</p>

<p>Whispering didn’t know how near he had come to
the truth when he said she had seen a ghost. He
told Len about it when they got back to the ranch,
but Nan assured them that she was entirely
recovered.</p>

<p>Hashknife and Sleepy were in the Oasis Saloon
when Pollock came in. He shook hands with Cole
and with several other men, drank with them, and
then went back with Cole to his private office.</p>

<p>Hashknife was tilted back against the wall, with
his hat over his eyes, and after the two men had
entered the back room, he tilted forward, got to his
feet, and walked outside with Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Recognise the black-coated gent who just came
in, Sleepy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Didn’t pay much attention to him. Who is
he?”</p>

<p>“I dunno who he is now,” thoughtfully. “About
three or four years ago a gambler by the name of
Jack Evans shot a feller in the Golden Arrow Saloon
in Redfields. They quarrelled over a poker game,
and Evans shot him with a derringer. The man
didn’t die, but he was badly crippled, and there was
a warrant for Evans, who got away. Remember
that, Sleepy?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I remember the shootin’. Is this Jack
Evans?”</p>

<p>“If it ain’t, it’s his ghost. I don’t forget faces.
Yuh see, I’ve played poker with him. He’s got a
scar on the back of his left hand; sort of a white
half-moon, where a Mexican pinned his hand to a
poker table in Laredo. Wore a big cameo ring on
the same hand. The ring may be gone, but the scar
will show.”</p>

<p>“Do yuh reckon he’s still wanted in Redfields?”</p>

<p>“That’s not our business. Let Redfields capture
their own criminals. What interests me is the fact
that he’s here in a small town with one arm in a
sling. Harry Cole and the bunch seem to know him
very well; so this may be where he hangs out
when the police need him pretty bad.”</p>

<p>“Do yuh think he’ll recognise you, Hashknife?”</p>

<p>“Not a chance in a thousand. We never locked
horns in any way, and he prob’ly dealt cards to a
lot of suckers since he dealt to me.”</p>

<p>They mentioned Pollock to Breezy.</p>

<p>“Jack Pollock? Shore I know him. He used to
work for Harry Cole. Oh, he was here a long time.
Yuh say he’s back? He’s all right, jist a little
slick, thasall. Mebbe Harry sent for him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him,” said Hashknife. “Heard
them call him Pollock. He’s got his left arm in a
sling.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? Well, he prob’ly got clumsy on the
deal. Some folks demand an honest deal, it seems.
Oh, I don’t say he’s a crooked dealer, Hashknife.
Lotsa other ways for him to git hurt. Might have
fallen out of a balloon, f’r instance. I’d be the last
one to ever say anythin’ against him.”</p>

<p>Hashknife dropped the subject, as far as the
conversation was concerned, but did not dismiss it
from his mind. It might be the natural thing for
Pollock to visit the place where he had formerly
lived and worked, but Hashknife did not figure
that a man of Pollock’s reputation would do the
natural thing. He took it for granted that Pollock
was there for some other reason than a visit.</p>

<p>Hashknife drifted back to the Oasis a little later,
giving Pollock plenty of chances to recognise him,
but the gambler merely glanced at him and went
on talking with Cole. Hashknife noticed that his
left hand was bandaged to the knuckles, precluding
any chance of an identifying glimpse of any scar
on the back of that hand.</p>

<p>Pollock did not take a room at the hotel, but
occupied one of Cole’s rooms over the saloon, where
Cole’s other two dealers slept. Cole’s own bed was
in his private office.</p>

<p>That evening about eight o’clock Amos Baggs
came in to the sheriff’s office, where Ben Dillon was
seated at his desk, writing a letter.</p>

<p>Baggs did not sit down, but stood beside the desk
and came to the point immediately.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you about Len Ayres,
Dillon,” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s he done now, Baggs?”</p>

<p>“This has nothing to do with what he has already
done; it’s what he might do. You probably know
that he hates me for what happened during his trial
five years ago. Well,” Amos sighed deeply, “he
came to me with all kinds of threats. I tried to
smooth things over, but it was no use. You wonder
how he got the job of foreman on the Box S? I’ll
tell you why he got it, Dillon; it was because he
said he’d cut off my ears if I didn’t give it to him.”</p>

<p>“Bein’ your ears,” said the sheriff thoughtfully,
“you wanted to save ’em.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. I asked Miss Singer to give him the
job. I was retained by Harmony Singer during the
last few months of his life, and as I drew his will
and located the heir, it would naturally follow that
I have charge of the business, at least until after
the will is probated and the owner established.”</p>

<p>“Looks thataway,” agreed Ben, who knew little
law.</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t!” snapped Baggs. “Ayres
has blocked me in every way. He hates me. I’ve
been ordered off the ranch, and threatened with
bodily injury if I return. Miss Singer does not confer
with me in anything. If you were in my place,
would you allow such a condition to remain?”</p>

<p>Ben rubbed his stubbled chin thoughtfully. He
looked up at Baggs, a quizzical expression in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Just how much do you value yore ears, Amos?”</p>

<p>Baggs adjusted his collar, shrugged his shoulders
wearily.</p>

<p>“We’ll drop that matter,” he said flatly, and
then as an afterthought, “I don’t suppose any effort
is being made to discover Prentice’s murderer.”</p>

<p>“Any effort? Jist what kind of an effort do yuh
mean? We ain’t made no house-to-house canvass,
if that’s what yuh mean.”</p>

<p>Baggs put his lean hands on the desk and leaned
forward.</p>

<p>“If I was the prosecuting attorney of this county,
I’d⸺”</p>

<p>“But you ain’t,” interrupted the sheriff. “If yuh
don’t mind, we’ll leave⸺”</p>

<p>Ben didn’t finish his advice. Came the crash of a
window pane behind the sheriff, showering him with
glass; a sharp cry from Baggs, the thud of a bullet
smashing into the wall, and from somewhere outside
came the whiplike report of a rifle, the echoes
clattering back from the buildings.</p>

<p>Ben’s presence of mind caused him to fall over
backward against the wall, clawing for his six-shooter.
Baggs staggered sidewise, almost fell, recovered
and stood there trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>“Git away from the window, yuh damn’ ignorant
fool!” roared the sheriff, but Baggs didn’t understand.
His hands were clawing at his chest.</p>

<p>Some one shouted from across the street, men
were running on the sidewalk. Ben slid low beneath
the window sill, came up against the wall. He
wasn’t going to get in line with that window again.</p>

<p>“They hit me,” said Baggs dumbly. “They hit
me.”</p>

<p>“Stay right where yuh are, and they’ll hit yuh
again,” said the sheriff sarcastically.</p>

<p>But the shooting was over. A man sprang on the
sidewalk in front of the office and threw the door
open. It was Breezy.</p>

<p>“Where was that shot?” he began, but stopped.
Sleepy joined him in the doorway.</p>

<p>“They shot Baggs,” said the sheriff.</p>

<p>“He’s still on his feet,” grunted Breezy. “Where’d
it hit yuh, Amos?”</p>

<p>They crowded around him. Sleepy picked up an
object against the opposite wall, a small tangle of
metal and smashed wheels.</p>

<p>“Here’s yore watch,” he said, holding it out.</p>

<p>An examination showed that the bullet had cut
through Baggs’s left coat sleeve near the shoulder,
ripped across his chest, barely scoring the skin,
picking up his watch and fountain pen, and had
torn his right coat sleeve, but did not tear his shirt.</p>

<p>Baggs’s face was white and he shook weakly. An
inch or two to the right, and Amos Baggs’s career
would have been closed. He sat down in a chair
and covered his face with his hands, while more
men crowded in. Harry Cole, one of his dealers, and
several cattlemen came over from the Oasis.</p>

<p>Everybody wanted to know what it was all about.
Baggs was unable to talk about it. The sheriff told
them what had happened, they examined the evidence
and departed, taking Baggs with them. He
had a keen desire to stay with a crowd.</p>

<p>Breezy and Sleepy stayed with the sheriff, who
hung a blanket over the smashed window and sat
down to smoke it over.</p>

<p>“The question is: who wants to kill Baggs?”
mused Breezy.</p>

<p>“Hang the whole town,” grunted the sheriff.
“By golly, he almost grabbed a harp that time.”</p>

<p>“Are yuh sure they didn’t shoot at you, Ben?”
asked Breezy.</p>

<p>“Not a chance. No sir, they wanted Amos.”</p>

<p>“A worthy want,” grinned Breezy. “Me and
Sleepy was playin’ pool in the Oasis, and that shot
sure sounded loud.”</p>

<p>Sleepy grinned over his cigarette, but suddenly
sobered.</p>

<p>“Did any of yuh see Hashknife lately?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Not since supper,” replied the sheriff. “I seen
both of yuh over at the restaurant.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny to me.”</p>

<p>Sleepy got to his feet and walked quickly out of
the office. It was unlike Hashknife not to be in
evidence when there was shooting going on. Sleepy
went up one side of the street and down the other,
as far as the depot, but did not find Hashknife in
any of the buildings.</p>

<p>He came back to the Oasis, where he met Breezy,
who had also been looking for Hashknife, but
without results. Together they went to the livery
stable, only to find that Hashknife’s gray horse was
in its stall, contentedly munching hay.</p>

<p>“That’s shore got me beat,” confessed Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Well, he can take care of himself,” said
Breezy.</p>

<p>“Prob’ly better than you think, Breezy. I
suppose I might as well sit tight and wait for him
to show up.”</p>

<p>They went back and finished their game of pool,
but Sleepy’s mind was not on his shots. The attempt
to murder Baggs made Sleepy nervous. As soon as
they finished their game, Sleepy left Breezy, who
was interested in a poker game, and went over to
the hotel, never dreaming that Hashknife might be
there.</p>

<p>He found his tall partner slumped down in an old
rocker, reading a paper by the light of an oil lamp.
The room was foggy with cigarette smoke, which
eddied in the gust of wind from the open door.
Sleepy noticed that the shade had been drawn over
their one window.</p>

<p>“I’ve been huntin’ all over town for you,” he
told Hashknife. “Didn’t yuh hear that shot?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I heard it.”</p>

<p>“Yuh did? And you stayed here? Whatsa
matter, cowboy?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t anybody killed, was there?”</p>

<p>“Somebody dang near killed Amos Baggs, the
lawyer.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“They shore did.”</p>

<p>Sleepy described how the bullet came through the
sheriff’s window and within an inch or so of killing
Baggs. Hashknife grinned through the recital. It
was amusing to him.</p>

<p>“And you sat here, readin’ an old paper, and
never looked to see what it was all about, eh?”
said Sleepy. “Well, that ain’t a bit like you.
Kinda losin’ interest, or was the paper so danged
interestin’?”</p>

<p>Hashknife yawned widely and laid the paper
aside.</p>

<p>“I was readin’ how to stay beautiful after yo’re
over forty,” he grinned. “It’s worth readin’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll betcha,” laughed Sleepy. He leaned forward
and looked closely at Hashknife. “Whatcha been
doin’—cuttin’ yore ear with a razor?”</p>

<p>Hashknife reached up, fingered his ear and looked
at the smear of blood on his fingers.</p>

<p>“Piece of that glass must have flew back,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Piece of what glass?”</p>

<p>“From the sheriff’s window, Sleepy. I reckon
my head was about on a level with Baggs’s vest
pockets.”</p>

<p>“You mean that somebody tried to kill you
instead of Baggs?”</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned Hashknife. “I don’t want to
steal any glory from Mr. Baggs; but I’m afraid
that’s about what happened.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t do anythin’ about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. I ducked down the alley, sneaked in
the backway and read the newspaper. Don’t tell
anybody, Sleepy.”</p>

<p>“It’ll probably scare Baggs out of the country,
Hashknife.”</p>

<p>“Be a great thing for the country.”</p>

<p>“But why would anybody try to kill you? Don’t
set there and grin like a danged fool! Do you know
what it’s all about?”</p>

<p>“Nope; that’s why it’s amusin’, Sleepy. Somebody
is scared.”</p>

<p>“Scared?”</p>

<p>“Scared enough to shoot at me. I wish I knew
why.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” seriously. Suddenly Sleepy grinned
widely. “By golly, we won’t sprout, Hashknife.
I believe Lobo Wells is human, after all.”</p>

<p>“Most places are, if yuh scratch ’em deep enough.
Let’s go to bed and get a good sleep.”</p>

<h2 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI: BAGGS PULLS STRINGS</h2>

<p>The following morning Sailor Jones came to Lobo
Wells after the mail. It was seldom that Sailor took
a drink, but when he did, he hated to stop. Such
was the case this morning. He got the mail, stuffed
it in his hip pocket, and was ready to go back when
somebody told him about Baggs nearly being killed.</p>

<p>“By grab, there is some good people left in the
world!” he exclaimed, and offered to buy his
informant a drink.</p>

<p>One drink was but a beginning, and by the time
Hashknife and Sleepy found him he was standing at
the Oasis bar trying to sing. If there was one thing
Sailor didn’t have, it was a voice, but he merely
nodded to Hashknife and continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<div>“Tell the ki-yotes, when they come at night,<br>
A huntin’ for their prey,<br>
They might as well go further,<br>
For they’ll find it will not pay;<br>
If they attempt to eat me-e-e<br>
They very soon will see-e-e<br>
That my bones and hide are petrified,<br>
They’ll find no meat on me-e-e-e.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>“That’s a great song!” applauded Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Ain’t she? Fit for a primmer-donner. How are
yuh?”</p>

<p>“Fine. How’s everythin’ at the Box S?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be any better, if I owned it m’self.
Say! Didja hear about old Baggs almost gittin’ his
earthly envelope slit? Ain’t that great! But the
only thing bad about it is the fact that the present
gineration can’t shoot straight. ’F I’d been behind
that gun, we’d be celebratin’ a funeral right now.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t kill a man, would yuh?” asked
Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Men are different,” said Sailor owlishly. “I’m
not speakin’ of men, Mister—er⸺”</p>

<p>“Stevens,” said Hashknife.</p>

<p>“To be shore. How’re yuh, Steve? Pleased to
meetcha. Well, I’ve got to git home—’f I kin.
Gittin’ old, boys. Tha’s all right,” he pointed a
finger at the opposite wall. “Nex’ time the door
comes around, I’ll bus’ right through.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk to the hitchrack with yuh,” offered
Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Well, tha’s nice of yuh, I’m shore. ’Preciate it.
Whoa, Blaze! C’mon, par’ner.”</p>

<p>Hashknife walked out and helped him on his
horse. He untied the rope, looped it around the
horn, while Sailor gathered up his reins. Suddenly
he surged back on the reins, swung the horse around
in a sharp curve, socked home the spurs and let out
a yell, which could be heard all over town.</p>

<p>The horse made a lunging buck, almost unseating
Sailor, and the mail flew from his hip-pocket,
scattering out behind him, as he went streaking
down the street. Hashknife walked out and recovered
the mail, putting it in his own pocket.</p>

<p>“He’ll probably miss it later, and come back for
it,” laughed Sleepy, as they walked down to the
livery stable.</p>

<p>A little later Hashknife happened to think about
the mail, and took it from his pocket. There were
two letters to Whispering Taylor, which Hashknife
judged were from some patent-medicine manufacturers,
and one letter addressed to Miss Singer,
bearing the letterhead of Amos A. Baggs.</p>

<p>Hashknife turned the letter over and noticed that
the flap was not securely fastened. In fact, it could
have been opened by round handling. A flip of the
thumb, and it was open. Hashknife was not in the
habit of opening other people’s mail, but something
told him to look at the enclosure. It read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='ni'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Singer</span>,—I want
to have a talk with you,
so you’d better come to my office at once. It will
be decidedly to your interests not to ignore this
letter.</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:2em;'>“Very truly yours,</div>
<div style='text-align:right;'>“<span class='sc'>Amos Baggs</span>.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Hashknife put the letter back in the envelope
and sealed it securely, after which he shoved his
hands deep in his pockets and stood on the edge of
the sidewalk, deep in thought. It was rather a
queer letter, he thought. A threatening order from
a lawyer to a client.</p>

<p>Hashknife was puzzled. He did not believe that
Len Ayres had killed Charley Prentice, although
there was no evidence that any one else disliked him
enough to do it. And Hashknife hadn’t the slightest
idea who had shot at him. He was satisfied that he
had been the target, instead of Baggs. The underlying
motives were well concealed, but Hashknife
felt that somewhere he would dig up a key to the
mystery.</p>

<p>He found Sleepy and together they rode out to
the Box S. Sailor was sound asleep in the bunk-house,
and Whispering was outspoken in his disgust
of any man who would get drunk in the morning.</p>

<p>“He tried to tell us somethin’ about Baggs gittin’
killed,” said Whispering. “Was that right?”</p>

<p>Hashknife explained what had happened, and
Whispering was duly impressed.</p>

<p>“Lobo Wells is wakin’ up to what it needs,” he
said seriously. “I don’t back no murderer’s play,
but I do think the town needs cleanin’ up, Hartley.
Len’s gone over to the OK this mornin’. Knight
wants us to go in with him on a trainload of beef;
so Len went to talk with him. The boss is somewhere
in the house, if yuh want to see her.”</p>

<p>Hashknife gave Whispering his two letters, and
explained about Sailor losing the mail.</p>

<p>“That’s jist like him! Valuables don’t mean
nothin’ to him, when he gits a drink or two. Look
at these letters! ’F it hadn’t been for you they’d
be lost, and I’d never know how to cure liver complaints
and as-my.”</p>

<p>Nan came out through the kitchen and greeted
them warmly.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard voices out here,” she said,
“but I wasn’t sure it wasn’t Whispering and Sailor.
They converse quite a bit, as you probably know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I put him to bed,” grinned Whispering.
“He was wrong about Amos Baggs gittin’ killed—he
was jist shot at. Hartley can tell yuh the
gruesome details.”</p>

<p>Hashknife explained to Nan, and then gave her
the letter. He watched her closely as she glanced at
the letterhead, and there was a worried look in
her eyes, as she thanked him for bringing it. After
a few moments she went back in the house.</p>

<p>Whispering urged them to stay for dinner, but
Hashknife wanted to get back to town.</p>

<p>Shortly after Hashknife and Sleepy rode away,
Nan came out to the kitchen and asked Whispering
to hitch the team to the buckboard and take her
to town.</p>

<p>In the meantime Len had talked with Knight at
the OK ranch. Knight happened to have been in
Lobo Wells when the shot had smashed through the
sheriff’s window.</p>

<p>“I suppose they’ll blame me for that,” said Len.</p>

<p>“They probably will,” smiled Knight. “Some of
them will blame yuh for not shootin’ straighter.”</p>

<p>“I guess Baggs isn’t very popular.”</p>

<p>“It’s his own fault, Len. He can’t keep his nose
out of things that don’t concern him.”</p>

<p>Len rode away from the OK, intending to go
back to the Box S, but changed his mind and rode
north to Lobo Wells. He was worried about Larry.
Len wanted the boy, and he did not understand
just why his son would not come out to the ranch
with him. He had seemed so friendly that first day,
but had entirely changed his attitude.</p>

<p>Instead of going in on the main street he went
straight to the Prentice house. On the porch was a
battered old telescope valise and a couple of half-filled
gunny-sacks. Minnie answered his knock. She
was wearing a rusty black dress, which fitted her
like the casing on a sausage, a moth-eaten old
feather boa, and on her head, perched high, threatening
at any time to lose its balance, was a small black
straw hat, decorated with a single eagle feather,
pointing straight toward the sky.</p>

<p>“How do,” she said shortly.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” smiled Len. “Where’s the boy?”</p>

<p>Larry came in from the kitchen, a woebegone
expression on his face. Len smiled at him, but the
boy did not respond.</p>

<p>“I go way,” said Minnie. “Wait for stage now.”</p>

<p>“Where are yuh goin’?” asked Len.</p>

<p>“I go to my people down by Kernwood.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah? Goin’ to stay?”</p>

<p>“Stay long time, I guess.”</p>

<p>“What about the boy?” asked Len, pointing at
Larry.</p>

<p>Minnie looked at him, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll be all right,” said Larry.</p>

<p>“You can’t stay here alone, Larry.”</p>

<p>The question seemed deadlocked until Minnie
came to the rescue with:</p>

<p>“Baggs say nobody pay me now, I go home.
Baggs say county take care of boy.”</p>

<p>“I can take care of myself,” said Larry
quickly.</p>

<p>The Kernwood stage drew up in front of the
house, and Minnie went waddling out with her valise
and bundles. Len watched her climb aboard the
stage, and then turned to Larry.</p>

<p>“Son, I want yuh to tell me what Baggs said.
C’mon and sit down here with me, ’cause me and
you are goin’ to have a talk about ourselves.”</p>

<p>Larry sat down on the opposite side of the steps
from Len.</p>

<p>“Baggs told Minnie to go home,” he said wearily.
“He said that the county would have to take care
of me, but I can take care of myself.”</p>

<p>“Plenty nerve,” muttered Len admiringly.
“Larry, why won’t yuh go out to the ranch with
me? I need yuh—need another cowpuncher out
there. Me and you would git along great. The
boss is a nice lady.”</p>

<p>Larry thought it over for a while, torn between
two emotions.</p>

<p>“Mr. Baggs said I hadn’t better.”</p>

<p>“Since when did you start takin’ orders from
Baggs, Larry?”</p>

<p>Larry shut his lips tightly. He was a very little
boy, but there were things he couldn’t forget.</p>

<p>“Will yuh tell me why yuh won’t go out and
live with me?” asked Len. “I ought to know,
Larry. After all, you are my son.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” he was near tears now.
“Mr. Baggs said it wasn’t the place for me. He
said you—you⸺”</p>

<p>“He said I wasn’t fit to have yuh, son?”</p>

<p>Larry nodded miserably.</p>

<p>“Because I had been in prison, Larry?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess that was—was part of it.”</p>

<p>“I see. And he said I killed Charley Prentice,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He—he said you was a killer, and that folks
wouldn’t care to have anythin’ to do with me if
I lived with you.”</p>

<p>If Amos Baggs had been in reach at that moment
Len might have lived up to the reputation Amos had
given him.</p>

<p>“Son,” he said tensely, “would you believe me
if I told yuh that I never shot Charley Prentice?”</p>

<p>The boy swallowed painfully, gripped his hands
tightly around one knee, but finally shook his head.</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t yuh, son?”</p>

<p>“Because, I—I know yuh did.”</p>

<p>Len got to his feet and stared down at the boy,
who did not dare look up at him.</p>

<p>“You <i>know</i> I did?” asked Len wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I heard you.” Larry was crying now. “Me and
Minnie promised never to tell. We heard you say:
‘This is Ayres, you dirty dog.’ And then the gun
went off twice.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” said Len softly.</p>

<p>For a long time he stood there, staring off across
the old town, his face like carved granite in the
shadow of his wide sombrero.</p>

<p>“We never told nobody—but you,” whispered
Larry.</p>

<p>“Thank yuh, son.”</p>

<p>“I dunno what to do,” said Larry miserably.
“Minnie’s gone now.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t afraid of me, are yuh?” asked Len.</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t afraid of yuh.”</p>

<p>“Then won’t yuh try livin’ on the ranch? Yuh
won’t have to have anythin’ to do with me—just
live there.”</p>

<p>“I guess it would be all right—if I had a job.”</p>

<p>“Can yuh cut wood, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I can cut wood—fine.”</p>

<p>“We need a wood-cutter pretty bad. Whisperin’
makes a lot of biscuits and pies and cookies, and he
needs wood.”</p>

<p>“Minnie wasn’t much good on pies and cookies.”</p>

<p>“C’mon, boy; we’ll get yore clothes later.”</p>

<p>Larry closed the front door softly and walked out
with Len, who untied his horse and they went down
toward the main street; a man whose greenish-gray
eyes registered a momentary triumph, his lips set
in a killing resolve; and a boy who looked ahead
at a future of pies and cookies—and a man’s job.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ over and tell Mr. Baggs about it,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Guess he won’t like it much.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make him like it, pardner.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Whispering had brought Nan to
town, and left her at the lawyer’s office. She realised
that she was at the end of her string; the tone of
the letter told her that much.</p>

<p>For the first time since the beginning of her
masquerade she was afraid of the consequences, but
she summoned up all her reserve strength and went
into the office, prepared at least to battle for a
chance to drop out gracefully, but realising that
Baggs was not the type to be lenient with an
offender.</p>

<p>He was there at his desk, bowed over some
papers, a dead pipe between his teeth. She stopped
near his desk and he stared at her for several
moments, before he got to his feet and indicated
his chair. No word had passed between them. He
closed the door tightly and came back to stand
near her.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Impersonator, what about it?” he
jeered. “Thought you could steal another woman’s
identity, eh? Didn’t you know it was a prison
offence? No? Just playing a joke on us,
eh?”</p>

<p>He pointed a lean forefinger at her threateningly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you realise that I could send you to
prison for a nice long time for what you’ve done?
Maybe I will—it all depends on what you do, young
lady.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” asked Nan
helplessly.</p>

<p>Baggs walked to the window and looked out on
the street. He was a firm believer in suspense.
Finally he turned.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you’ll do. Perhaps it isn’t
what you want to do, but you’ll do it or go to jail.
Pack up your little valise and catch the first train
out of town. I’ll give you until to-morrow noon.
That’s more consideration than I’ve ever shown
anybody before. I guess I’m getting soft. I’ll fix
up some sort of a story to cover the situation.”</p>

<p>“Can you prove that I am not Miss Singer?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Prove it?” Baggs laughed harshly. “Do you
want me to?”</p>

<p>“By Jack Pollock?” asked Nan.</p>

<p>“Oh, you knew he was here, did you? Do you
want me to bring him over here and face you with
it? Your name is Nan Whitlock, or that’s the name
he knew you by in Frisco. No doubt you’ve had a
good many names. People who do what you
attempted here would naturally have used many
names.”</p>

<p>“Then I either get out or you send me to jail?”</p>

<p>“If you are here to-morrow noon, I’ll send⸺”</p>

<p>Came the sound of a swift, heavy step on the
sidewalk in front of the office, the door was flung
violently open and Len Ayres stepped in. Behind
him was little Larry. For a moment Ayres looked
at Nan, then he turned on Baggs, who had stepped
back, a frightened look in his weak eyes.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to say a few short words to you,
Baggs,” said Len hoarsely. “I’m takin’ my son out
to the Box S to live there. Contrary to yore advice,
the county won’t take him, because I won’t let
’em. You’ve done yore best to poison his mind
against me, you dirty pup; and I want you to get
this straight; if you ever do another thing against
me, I’ll shoot yore dirty soul plumb out of yore
skinny carcass.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s what you tried to do last night,”
said Baggs rashly, and with one swift stride Len
grabbed him, slammed him against the wall and
held him helpless, while with a free hand he proceeded
to slap Baggs’s face until the Lobo Wells
lawyer shrieked for mercy.</p>

<p>When Len let him loose, Baggs slid weakly to the
floor, holding his face in both hands. Len looked at
him disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Gee, what a slappin’ he got!” exclaimed Larry.</p>

<p>Len turned to Nan, who had got to her feet.</p>

<p>“I suppose we might as well go home, Nan;
that feller ain’t in no shape to talk business.”</p>

<p>Nan nodded, and they walked out together.
Whispering was coming across to the buckboard,
and they walked over there.</p>

<p>“Larry can ride with you folks,” said Len.
“Larry, this is Miss Singer, the boss of the Box S,
and this man is Whisperin’ Taylor, the man who
makes the pies and cookies.”</p>

<p>“When I can git wood enough,” grinned Whispering,
shaking hands with Larry.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m comin’ out for—to cut wood,”
said Larry.</p>

<p>“By golly, we’ll have plenty pie now. Pile in,
Larry; the Box S Limited is ready to pull out.”</p>

<p>Larry shook hands gravely with Nan, and they
started home, while Amos Alexander Baggs watched
them from the window of his office, too mad to do
more than grimace with his aching jaws and blink
the tears out of his eyes.</p>

<h2 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII: MYSTERY</h2>

<p>It was from Horace Baker, elderly clerk of the court,
that Hashknife learned some of the facts about Len
Ayres’s trial. Baker had been clerk of the court for
ten years, being elected every two years, because
no one else wanted the office. The transcript of
testimony was all on file, but Hashknife did not
ask to read it.</p>

<p>According to Baker, a lone bandit had twice
operated successfully within a period of a month.
The Wells Fargo safe had been smashed one night
between Lobo Wells and Randall, netting the bandit
about ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Less than a month later the Kernwood stage,
carrying five thousand dollars in the strong box,
was robbed just out of Lobo Wells, and the description
of the lone robber tallied closely to that of the
man who had robbed the express car. Descriptions
given by men who have been looking down the
muzzle of a gun are seldom accurate enough for
identification, so the officers merely waited for the
bandit to break out again.</p>

<p>It had come sooner than they anticipated, it
seemed. Charley Prentice, transferring money from
his window to the safe near closing time, the bank
being empty of customers at the time, turned his
head at a sound and found himself confronted by a
masked cowboy.</p>

<p>According to Prentice’s testimony, the man spoke
hoarsely, demanding all the money in the safe.
Prentice was in no position to refuse, and had given
the man what later proved to be seven thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>At this moment a man came along the sidewalk
in front of the bank, which was still open, and the
bandit struck Prentice a sharp blow on the jaw
with his fist, knocking Prentice down and badly
dazing him, and then leaped the railing and going
out through a rear entrance before Prentice could
recover.</p>

<p>The man who had stopped in front of the bank
was Amos Baggs, at that time prosecuting attorney,
and he came in just in time to see the bandit stumble
in the rear doorway, his hat falling back into the
bank. Baggs did not know that the bank had been
robbed, until he found Prentice on his hands and
knees trying to stand up.</p>

<p>Even then Baggs did not realise what had been
done until Prentice managed to explain, when Baggs
ran for the sheriff, Harry Cole. Then Baggs remembered
the bandit’s hat, which they found against
the rear wall of the bank near the door, and in the
sweat-band had been stamped the initials L.A.</p>

<p>According to Horace Baker, Len had no defence.</p>

<p>He admitted ownership of the hat, but said it had
been misplaced at home and that he had been
wearing an old one. The hat was a nearly-new
Stetson and so large that the jury smiled when he
said that it had been misplaced.</p>

<p>But Len refused to tell them where the money
had been hidden, and they convicted him on the
strength of the hat. Prentice was partly able to
identify Len as the robber, and his first description
covered the cowboy fairly well.</p>

<p>Baker told Hashknife that he had known Mrs.
Ayres for a number of years, and had known
Prentice since he came to work for the bank.</p>

<p>“Was she a pretty woman?” queried Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, she was; very pretty.”</p>

<p>“Did she attend the trial?”</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t. A great many people thought
she was wrong in not attending, but I suppose she
didn’t feel that way about it.”</p>

<p>“Was she happy with Len?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Hartley. She was a woman who
liked to dress well and have a good time, and Len
wasn’t makin’ much money. I’ve always had an
idea that was why Len turned bandit.”</p>

<p>“To buy her things, yuh mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do yuh reckon she got the money?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she did. Some folks seemed to
think that Prentice married her to get some of it.
But I guess Len was too wise for all of them. He’s
no fool. Some day he’ll dig up all that money,
disappear out of the country and have a nice bunch
of cash to start in business for himself.”</p>

<p>All of that was merely conjecture, and Hashknife
left Baker’s office no wiser than he had been before.
As far as he could learn from talking with the residents
of Lobo Wells, they considered Len guilty of
all three robberies, and it was the general opinion
that some day Len would dig up the twenty-two
thousand dollars and leave the country.</p>

<p>Hashknife wondered what Amos Baggs would
have to say about his near assassination and as he
left the little courthouse he decided to talk with
Baggs. The buckboard, carrying Nan, little Larry
and Whispering, was just leaving town as Hashknife
came out on the street.</p>

<p>He paid no attention to whose equipage it was,
but sauntered up the street to Baggs’s office, shoved
the door open and walked in. Baggs was slumped
down in his chair, his collar loose on one end and
standing up past one ear, his necktie torn. He lifted
a scarlet face and stared at Hashknife. There were
plenty of welts in evidence, attesting to the fact
that Len was heavy of hand.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you—smallpox?”
asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>Baggs heaved himself up from his chair, fairly
spitting with rage, not realising that Hashknife did
not know what had happened.</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” he croaked. “Get out!
By God, I’ll be well paid for this! I’ll kill somebody!
I’ll⸺”</p>

<p>“You act as though yuh was mad,” said Hashknife
calmly.</p>

<p>“Get out! Don’t talk to me! Will you leave
this office?”</p>

<p>“Shore. I’ll tell the sheriff, so that he can come
up and tie yuh to a tree.”</p>

<p>“Damn yuh! Leave the sheriff out of this.
I’ll⸺”</p>

<p>Hashknife closed the door behind him, wondering
what in the world was the matter with Baggs, who
was still raving. He found Dillon and Breezy at
the office, and told them what Baggs had said and
how Baggs had looked.</p>

<p>“What do yuh reckon is eatin’ him?” wondered
Dillon.</p>

<p>“Capillary fit,” said Breezy.</p>

<p>“You mean cataleptic fit,” corrected Dillon.
“Capillary has somethin’ to do with hair, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“If it does, I mean capillary. His hair is so tight
it cramps his brain.”</p>

<p>“I guess yo’re right, Breezy,” grinned the sheriff.
“Mebbe he ain’t got over his scare of last night. I
don’t blame him.”</p>

<p>“Who do yuh reckon tried to kill him?” asked
Hashknife.</p>

<p>The sheriff shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>“I dunno. The longer I’m in this office the less
I savvy about crime. I used to read detective
stories, about ’em findin’ clues and all that, and
puttin’ the deadwood on a criminal. Them writers
lied. Yuh can’t do it. When a shot is fired in the
dark, and all yuh see is the flash, how are yuh goin’
to deduct who pulled the trigger? Can’t be done.
Who would bushwhack Amos Baggs? Why not
kill him openly and get a medal? Who shot Charley
Prentice? You answer it, I can’t. I’ve lost all
faith in detective stories. I tell yuh, it’s all luck,
when yuh catch a criminal. Instead of votin’ a
man into this office, they ought to check up and
find out who is the luckiest man in the county.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s a lot of luck connected with it,”
agreed Hashknife.</p>

<p>“A lot? It’s all luck. Brains don’t do yuh any
good, unless yuh carry a horseshoe and a rabbit’s
foot.”</p>

<p>Nan Whitlock was doing a lot of thinking about
her luck, as the buckboard lurched over the rough
road to the Box S. There was no question in her
mind that she must get out of the Lobo Wells
country before the following noon or go to jail.
But how to get away without explaining? That
was the rub.</p>

<p>Whispering and Larry kept up a spirited conversation,
but Nan’s mind was too busy to allow her
to join them. The boy seemed filled with joy over
the prospect of living at the ranch, and boasted of
his prowess with an axe.</p>

<p>“Yuh got to show me,” declared Whispering.
“I’ve seen a lot of you braggin’ cowboys, old timer.
How are yuh with a rope?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” admitted the seven-year-old.</p>

<p>“Don’t mean a thing. We’ve got to have ’em
perfect.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can practice, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“Shore. Work yore string on the cat. When
yuh can forefoot a cat, yo’re a dinger. I used to know
a Mexican who could rope lizards with a fish line.
How are yuh with a six-gun, Larry?”</p>

<p>“I never had one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stop that. Sailor’s got an old one, and
I’ll steal it for yuh. Needs quite a lot of fixin’, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll fix it all right.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, yo’re shore a handy man for to have,
don’tcha think so, Nan?”</p>

<p>“I think he is wonderful, Whispering.”</p>

<p>“More’n that; he’s almost unbelievable.”</p>

<p>Len was at the ranch ahead of them. Whispering
drove the team up to the front porch and Nan
started to jump out, but the restless team jerked
ahead and Nan went sprawling.</p>

<p>For a moment she was dazed, but a sharp pain
through her left ankle caused her to sit up quickly,
and at the same instant Len reached her. Whispering
was swearing at the team and trying to saw their
heads off with the bits, while Larry clung to the
seat with one hand and his hat with the other.</p>

<p>“Hurt yuh, Nan?” Len asked quickly.</p>

<p>“My ankle!” she whispered. “I think it is
broken.”</p>

<p>“Gosh a’mighty, I hope not!”</p>

<p>He picked her up bodily and carried her in the
house, while Whispering quickly tied the team and
came in. Len took off her shoe and cut the stocking
loose with his knife. The ankle was swelling rapidly,
but after a quick examination Len said:</p>

<p>“I think it’s a bad sprain, Nan. Heat some water,
Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>Len mixed some whisky with water and asked
Nan to swallow it.</p>

<p>“It’ll do yuh good,” he said. “Yuh need a
bracer.”</p>

<p>The liquor made her a little light-headed, but
helped her to bear the pain of having the ankle
soaked in hot water, and afterward Len bound it
tightly with strips from a sheet.</p>

<p>She managed to get to bed, where she lay white-faced,
staring up at the ceiling. Suddenly she
realised that it would be impossible for her to leave
within her allotted time. Len came in and sat down
beside the bed.</p>

<p>“That was shore some shock for yuh,” he told
her. “Yore face is almost as white as the pillow,
Nan. Can I have Whisperin’ cook somethin’ especial
for yuh for supper?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t eat,” she said wearily. Suddenly an
inspiration came to her, and she said:</p>

<p>“Len, I—I told Mr. Baggs I’d be in to see him
in the morning. It was important, you see. But
I can’t see him now, and I wondered if Sailor would
go to Lobo Wells to-night and tell him what
happened.”</p>

<p>“Why, shore, Nan. I’ll send Sailor right after
supper. Is that all yuh want to tell him?”</p>

<p>“That’s all, Len; that I can’t walk. He will
understand.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will. Is there anythin’ else?”</p>

<p>“No; just that.”</p>

<p>Len left the room, and in spite of the throbbing
ankle Nan fell asleep, feeling sure that Amos Baggs
would understand and be human enough to give
her a few days of grace.</p>

<h2 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII: SHREWD QUESTIONS</h2>

<p>A short time after Hashknife had been ordered
from Baggs’s office and had talked with the sheriff,
he ran across Johnny Harris of the JP outfit, who
imparted the information that Len had taken his
boy out to the Box S. Johnny had seen Nan go
to Baggs’s office and had also seen Len go there.</p>

<p>“I dunno what happened,” he told Hashknife,
“but I saw Len go bustin’ into the office like he
was goin’ to eat Baggs up. In a danged short time
the girl comes out, lookin’ back, and then comes
Len kinda backin’ out. The kid never did get all
the way in. They piled into the buckboard with
Whisperin’, and away they went, except Len, who
piled on to his bronco and led the way.”</p>

<p>Hashknife got a grin out of this. He realised
that Len had been the cause of Baggs’s scalded look
about the face. That was the second time that Len
had chastised Baggs. It was no wonder that Baggs
was not in a gentle frame of mind.</p>

<p>After Johnny Harris left him, Hashknife sat on
the sidewalk and tried to reason out the situation.
Finally he gave up and went back to the sheriff’s
office, where he tried to get the sheriff’s reactions
on a few things. But Ben Dillon was not reacting
just at present.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he told Hashknife, “I don’t see why
you’re so danged concerned. Yuh act as though
you was sheriff, instead of me. If somebody wants
to shoot Amos Baggs, that’s their business.”</p>

<p>“Do yuh feel the same about Charley Prentice?”</p>

<p>“Well, that ain’t such a hell of a mystery, Hashknife.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’tcha arrest the guilty man?”</p>

<p>“Not a speck of evidence.”</p>

<p>“Then why ain’t it a mystery?”</p>

<p>“’Cause it ain’t. Ask anybody.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I ask Len Ayres?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that would be a sweet idea!”</p>

<p>Hashknife grinned at the fat sheriff.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to do that—to-night. I’ll betcha I’ll
find out a lot more from him than I have from
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make yuh a little bet on that.”</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned Hashknife. “if I find out
anythin’ at all, I’d win. You can’t tell me a thing.”</p>

<p>Harry Cole of the Oasis was also looking for
information, and a short time after Hashknife left
the office he came in. He wanted to know what the
sheriff had deduced on the attempted assassination
of Amos Baggs. The sheriff was getting touchy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know a danged thing, Harry. I’m goin’
to get me an answer book so I can talk back to you
jiggers.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Baggs is a little curious.”</p>

<p>“If he is, he keeps it to himself.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to be sore at me, Ben.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sore at yuh, Harry. I ain’t sore at anybody.
Just before yuh left, Hashknife Hartley was
in here, askin’ me a lot of fool questions, which
nobody can answer. Said he was goin’ out to ask
the same questions of Len Ayres, and he’d bet he’d
find out more from Len than he did from me.”</p>

<p>“What’s <i>his</i> idea of askin’ questions, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Answer yore own question. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Ben, who is this Hashknife Hartley?”</p>

<p>“A damn nuisance! I wish he’d get a job and
go to work. I’m tired of him hivin’ up in my office.
Breezy likes him, so here he stays. Mebby I’ll have
to fire Breezy to git rid of Hartley and his grinnin’
pardner. Half the time I don’t have a chair to set
on around here.”</p>

<p>The big gambler grinned lazily.</p>

<p>“This shootin’ stuff is gettin’ on yore nerves,
Ben.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t it git on yore nerves, when you was
sheriff?”</p>

<p>“They wasn’t shootin’ at me,” grinned Cole.</p>

<p>“Well, they ain’t shootin’ at me—yet. When
they do, I’ll quit. It’s bad enough to be questioned.”</p>

<p>Ben raked his spurred heel across the top of his
desk.</p>

<p>“Must be a damn brave man who shot at Baggs,”
he said savagely. “When yuh have to bushwhack
fellers like him it’s shore sneakin’. Next time I
hope they pick some other place for the killin’,
instead of my office.”</p>

<p>“Have yuh talked to Baggs about it, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Did yuh know that Len took his kid home with
him?”</p>

<p>“Did he? That’s fine.”</p>

<p>The sheriff was about out of conversation; so
Cole went back to the Oasis.</p>

<p>After supper that night Hashknife saddled his
gray horse and rode out to the Box S alone. Sleepy
had found it easy to beat Breezy playing pool;
so he was content to stay in town. Hashknife met
Sailor just outside Lobo Wells, and told him he
was going to the ranch. Sailor told him about Nan’s
spraining her ankle, but did not mention that he
was carrying a message to Amos Baggs.</p>

<p>Hashknife found Len at the stable, riveting a
buckle on the headstall of his bridle by the light of
a lantern, and Len seemed a little surprised to see
him. Hashknife sat down on a box and rolled a
smoke. He told Len what Sailor said about Nan’s
injury.</p>

<p>“If it ain’t better in the mornin’ I’ll get the
doctor,” said Len. “She’s asleep now. How’s
everythin’ in town?”</p>

<p>“All in good shape, except Amos Baggs.”</p>

<p>Len looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, his face is kinda sore, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah? Did he tell about me slappin’ him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he did,” grinned Hashknife, and
told Len how Baggs had ordered him out of the
office.</p>

<p>“Kinda funny about somebody shootin’ at
Baggs, Hartley.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it? I wonder who it was.”</p>

<p>Len shook his head, tested the buckle and laid
the bridle aside. He rolled a smoke and leaned back
against the wall, the aroma of his cigarette mingling
with the pungent odours of the stable. Moths
skittered around the lantern, a horse stamped
uneasily.</p>

<p>“You came out alone?” asked Len.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” nodded Hashknife. “I wanted to talk
with you, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“Thasso?” curiously. “Talk about what,
Hartley?”</p>

<p>“About you.”</p>

<p>Len smiled crookedly.</p>

<p>“Most folks talk about me to somebody else,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I’ve talked about yuh to other folks,” said
Hashknife seriously. “The whole danged trouble
is the fact that they all feel too much alike about
yuh, Ayres. Even those who say they like yuh a
lot, admit that you got away to a mighty bad start
in this country.”</p>

<p>“Even if that’s fact,” said Len grimly, “I don’t
see where it’s any of yore damn business, Hartley.
What do you care what people say about me? I
can run my business.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame yuh, Ayres. But listen to this,
and you’ll know why this is my business: I’m here
for the Wells Fargo. There, my cards are on the
table. Mebby I’m a fool to tell <i>you</i>, but I’m takin’
a chance. The sheriff doesn’t know what I’m here
for.”</p>

<p>“Wells Fargo, eh?” said Len softly. “So
they’re doggin’ my trail, waitin’ for me to dig up
that money so they can send me back to the rockpile.”</p>

<p>“They’re still curious about the ten thousand
they lost.”</p>

<p>“Did they think you’d recover it for them,
Hartley?”</p>

<p>“They’re not that foolish, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“So yo’re a detective, eh?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m a damn fool. No detective would be
crazy enough to conceal his identity from the
officers and expose it to the man he was to investigate.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. Well, suppose I tell yuh I don’t
know where the money is?”</p>

<p>“I’d believe yuh, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“Would yuh? Yo’re a hell of a detective!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” grinned Hashknife. “Let’s go back
a ways on this case. I heard that you turned bandit
to furnish yore wife with more money than you
could earn.”</p>

<p>Len got slowly to his feet and leaned against the
wall, his face in the shadow now.</p>

<p>“That’s a new one,” he said grimly. “I suppose
I threw away my hat in the bank to prove an alibi?
What’s the use, Hartley? If I didn’t pull them jobs,
you’d have a sweet time puttin’ the deadwood on
somebody else, after all this time.”</p>

<p>“Don’tcha want it proved, Ayres?”</p>

<p>Len was silent a while. Then:</p>

<p>“Hartley, my son thinks I’m a thief and a murderer.
Does that answer yore question?”</p>

<p>“It shore does. Did somebody tell him you shot
Prentice?”</p>

<p>Len stepped away from the wall and walked to
the stable door, where he looked out into the night.
Hashknife puffed away on his cigarette and waited
for Len to answer. Finally he came back and sat
down again.</p>

<p>“Hartley,” he said softly, “yo’re a queer sort of
a detective. You came here to spy on me, and yet
you tell me who yuh are. I’ll shoot square with
yuh. I’m as big a fool as you are; so I’m goin’
the limit with you. The night Charley Prentice was
shot, my boy heard that knock on the door. When
Prentice went to answer the knock, and threw the
door open, my boy heard a voice say: ‘This is
Ayres, you dirty dog!’ and then the shots were
fired.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah?” Hashknife leaned forward. “He
told you he heard that?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, and that was why he didn’t want to
come out here. To him, I’m a murderer. The squaw
heard it too. They agreed to never tell anybody;
but the boy told me. I reckon he wanted me to
know why he didn’t want to come out here.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I didn’t bet with the sheriff,” said
Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Bet what?”</p>

<p>“He wanted to bet that I wouldn’t find out any
more from you than I already knew.”</p>

<p>Len laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good it will ever do yuh.”</p>

<p>“I don’t either, Ayres; but it proves somethin’.
Either you killed Charley Prentice, or the man who
did kill him wanted the kid and the squaw to hear
who was doin’ the shootin’. And another thing—if
Prentice hadn’t died right away, he could have
sworn who shot him.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s true. If the sheriff knew what I’ve
told you, he’d jail me too quick, Hartley.”</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t know it from me. But there’s
another question, Ayres. This is pretty danged
personal, but I mean it for yore own good. Was
yore wife friendly with Prentice before you was
arrested?”</p>

<p>Len shifted his position, but did not answer.
He got to his feet and walked back to the door,
where he leaned out and listened.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard somebody,” he said, as he
came back. “I guess it was the dog. I don’t know
how to answer yore question, Hartley. She had
known Prentice a long time. We had a house in
Lobo Wells, yuh know. My wife wasn’t the kind
who liked to live out on a ranch. I’ll tell yuh the
honest facts of the case; we didn’t get along so
good. Mebby I was to blame. I worked hard to
get a start, but she didn’t appreciate it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a person was Harmony Singer?”
asked Hashknife, going off on another tack.</p>

<p>“The best on earth, Hartley.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard he was.”</p>

<p>“He stuck to me,” said Len softly, and added:
“Like a father.”</p>

<p>“Did you know this niece of his before yuh came
back?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, Hartley.”</p>

<p>“Heard Harmony Singer mention her?”</p>

<p>“Well, he never spoke about his relatives.
Harmony was kinda close-mouthed, yuh know. He
was originally from New Mexico, and I guess he was
a heller in his time. Died with his boots on, hung
to a stirrup. But if Heaven is a place for white
men, he’s there.”</p>

<p>Whispering came down to the stable. He was
rather surprised to find Hashknife there.</p>

<p>“Nan woke up,” he told Len. “Says the ankle
hurts quite a lot. Sailor ain’t back yet, is he?
He’ll prob’ly get drunk again.”</p>

<p>“Come on up to the house, Hartley,” invited Len.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll be headin’ back for town,” said
Hashknife.</p>

<p>Len walked over to Hashknife’s horse with him,
and they shook hands, before Hashknife mounted.
It was very dark along the road to Lobo Wells, so
Hashknife did not hurry. He pondered deeply over
what Len had told him, trying to figure some angle
on which to work. It meant going back five years,
and in five years many small details are lost.</p>

<p>He travelled along the dusty, sandy road, the tall
gray horse eating up distance with a swinging walk.
Less than a mile out of Lobo Wells the road crossed
Manzanita River on an old bridge, a narrow old
structure, which creaked threateningly. The river
here was mostly a big pot-hole below the bridge at
this time of year, where a few old cottonwood stumps
stuck their tops above the pool of dirty water.</p>

<p>Just before he reached the south end of the
bridge, the gray shied slightly. Hashknife jerked up
the reins quickly, but was unable to see anything in
the gloom. He rode on to the bridge and went
slowly across.</p>

<p>The bridge sloped rather sharply on the north
end, and as he rode down this incline he heard a
sharp whistle, apparently some distance behind
him; one sharp note. Instinctively he twisted in
his saddle, looking back, and at the same instant
he was blinded by a terrific flash, something hit him
with a stunning force and he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>But even in his helpless, unconscious state, he
seemed to hear voices. They seemed miles away,
yet audible.</p>

<p>“Let me shoot him again.”</p>

<p>“He’s plenty dead right now.”</p>

<p>Then he seemed to be sailing through space, and
he wondered whether a dead man was able to hear
people talk. It seemed ridiculous, but who would
know what a dead man could hear?</p>

<h2 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX: LEFT FOR DEAD</h2>

<p>Sleepy and Breezy were playing pool at the Oasis,
when the proprietor of the livery-stable came in.
He wended his way to Sleepy and informed him
that Hashknife’s gray horse had come back to the
stable, sans rider.</p>

<p>Sleepy dropped his cue on the table and headed
for the door, followed closely by Breezy. They
trotted down to the stable, where they found the
horse in a stall still saddled. Sleepy examined the
horse and saddle by lantern light, but found nothing
wrong with either.</p>

<p>“Must have broke away,” said Breezy.</p>

<p>“This horse don’t break away,” said Sleepy
nervously. “What do yuh suppose happened,
Breezy?”</p>

<p>“I gave yuh my theory, and almost got bit.”</p>

<p>“Saddle yore horse and let’s git goin’. Wait!
You take my roan and I’ll ride Ghost. If this horse
pulled out on Hashknife, it’s the first time he ever
did. I’ll saddle the roan for yuh. He’s kinda foolish
about strangers.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they rode out of the stable
and headed for the Box S. Sleepy didn’t know the
road very well, but he took the lead, and they went
streaking down across the old bridge, where the
hoofs of their running horses sounded like the quick
roll of a snare-drum.</p>

<p>Nor did they draw rein until they swept into the
yard of the Box S. Len and Sailor were in the
bunk-house, but came out at the sound of their
arrival. In answer to their questions, Len told them
approximately what time Hashknife had left there.</p>

<p>“That should have made me meet him,” said
Sailor. “I never rode fast. By golly, that makes
me wonder! After I left town and was pretty close
to the bridge, I thought I heard a shot. I wasn’t
sure which direction it was, and when I hit the
other end of the bridge my bronco shied at somethin’
in the dark. He’s in the habit of shyin’ thataway,
so I yanked him around and went on. It was so
danged dark I wouldn’t know I was on the bridge,
except that I could hear it under me.”</p>

<p>“That don’t sound so good to me,” said Sleepy.
“If somebody bushwhacked my pardner⸺”</p>

<p>“Who in hell would bushwhack him?” asked
Sailor quickly.</p>

<p>But Sleepy didn’t answer Sailor’s question. He
swung the gray around and said to Len:</p>

<p>“Lend me a lantern, will yuh?”</p>

<p>“I shore will, Stevens; and I’ll go along with
yuh.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the three riders left the ranch,
carrying the unlighted lantern.</p>

<p>Hashknife’s trip through space was rudely interrupted
by a souse of cold water, which brought back
consciousness in a flash. He flung out his arms
weakly and encountered water on all sides. He was
dazed, choked, fighting for breath, hardly knowing
what it was all about. His head bumped something,
which he instinctively grasped. It was an old stump.</p>

<p>He clung to this, trying to pump air into his
tortured lungs, while a heavy weight seemed to
press down on his head. As yet he did not remember
anything. His past, present and future were all a
blank, but still he fought for life. After a few
moments he began to get back a glimmering of
intelligence.</p>

<p>It seemed unnatural for him to be in the water.
As he seemed to remember, he was not an amphibian
creature. If he could only get that weight off his
mind. He lowered his feet and touched bottom.
After due reflection he shoved past the stump and
his groping hands came in contact with some gnarled
roots on the bank, where he managed to drag
himself out of the water.</p>

<p>Again the world whirled around and he lost
consciousness, but in a few moments he recovered
again, his mind more clear, but his head one bunch
of thumping nerves. Nausea overcame him and he
sprawled on the bank, too sick to care about anything.
He was still there when Sleepy and Breezy
rattled across the bridge, and it roused him up a
little.</p>

<p>He felt a little better, and he was beginning to
remember. The events of the evening came back to
him, although they seemed to have happened years
before.</p>

<p>His clothes were soaked and his boots were full of
water. He managed to remove his boots and empty
them. It was rather difficult for him to get on his
feet because everything seemed to whirl around,
but he gritted his teeth and staggered ahead to the
road.</p>

<p>Things were clearer to him now. He realised that
he had been shot, but was unable to discover the
exact spot where he had been hit. He was so wet
that he could not distinguish blood from water, but
he had a suspicion that he had been hit in the head.</p>

<p>“Bushwhacked,” he told himself. “That’s it.”</p>

<p>He dimly remembered the voices he had heard,
and that one had suggested shooting him again. In
spite of his condition he chuckled. Luck had been
with him once more. It seemed an interminably
long time before he saw the lights of Lobo Wells.
They danced before his eyes like lanterns on poles,
but he kept bravely on.</p>

<p>Something prompted him to keep off the main
street, and he managed to find the rear stairs of the
little hotel, where he climbed up and went to his
room without seeing anybody. After he lighted the
lamp and surveyed his features in the cheap mirror
over the pine dresser, he got an idea of the extent
of his injuries.</p>

<p>It appeared that a bullet had knocked a chunk
of flesh off just above his left eye, and another had
struck him a little farther back, behind the left
temple, and had cut a jagged furrow to the top of
his head. He mopped the gore away with a towel
and examined the wounds, which did not pain him
so much now.</p>

<p>“Looks as though I had been caressed with a few
pieces of buckshot,” he told his reflection. “That
bushwhacker misjudged his aim just enough to
slip me two outside pellets. No wonder he thought
I was plenty dead. That whole load would have
torn my head off.”</p>

<p>He washed out the wounds, bound his head in a
piece of pillow cover, stripped off his wet clothes
and went to bed. His head ached too much for
him to sleep, so he was still awake when Sleepy came
in, stopped in the doorway and stared at Hashknife’s
bandaged head.</p>

<p>Then Sleepy shut the door carefully and came
over to the bed.</p>

<p>“My Gawd!” said Sleepy. “What happened to
you, Hashknife?”</p>

<p>Hashknife told him, while Sleepy whistled softly.</p>

<p>“How didja get home?” asked Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Walked, I reckon. Don’t remember much
about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to get the doctor,” declared Sleepy.
“You lay still and don’t try to stop me. Here’s
yore hat.”</p>

<p>Sleepy picked the hat off the floor, where he had
dropped it when he came in.</p>

<p>“We found it on the bridge. And that ain’t all
we found.”</p>

<p>Sleepy dug down in his pocket, took out an object
and handed it to Hashknife. It was a derringer,
forty-one calibre, with a loaded cartridge still in the
single barrel.</p>

<p>“It was down in the rut on the far side of the
bridge,” said Sleepy at the doorway. “I’ll get the
doctor right away.”</p>

<p>“Derringer, eh?”</p>

<p>Hashknife smiled weakly and shoved the derringer
under his pillow.</p>

<h2 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX: THE SHERIFF COMES</h2>

<p>Nan’s ankle was pretty sore the next morning, but
she insisted on dressing, and Len carried her out to
breakfast. Sailor had already eaten his breakfast,
and was down at the stable.</p>

<p>Len told her about the boys going out to look
for Hashknife, and that he was anxious to find out
whether anything serious had happened. Little
Larry was down at the stable with Sailor, who was
saddling a burro for him to ride. They could hear
Larry’s high-pitched voice as he gave expert advice
on the matter.</p>

<p>“He’s a lovable little fellow,” said Nan. “This
ranch will be wonderful for him, Len.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t mind havin’ him here, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I love it.”</p>

<p>“I wondered if yuh would. Where do yuh want
to sit this mornin’? You can’t do much movin’
around, yuh know, and I’d kinda like to ride to
town and see if they found Hartley.”</p>

<p>“On the front porch. Don’t hurry on my account,
Len.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t be gone long.”</p>

<p>He carried her out on the porch and made her
comfortable in a rocker, stacking up some old
magazines beside her.</p>

<p>“Len,” she said seriously, “you are awful good
to me.”</p>

<p>“Mebby I am and mebby I ain’t,” he said
brusquely. “See you later.”</p>

<p>Larry came up to see her after a while, his face
flushed, clothes dusty.</p>

<p>“Me and the mule got along great,” he told her,
with a triumphant note in his voice. “Sailor says
I rode him to a frazzle. Sailor’s makin’ over a saddle
for me. Well, I’ve got to get back to work, I
s’pose.”</p>

<p>“What kind of work, Larry?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Cuttin’ wood for Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“You should call him Mr. Taylor, Larry.”</p>

<p>“I did—once. Then he said we was well enough
acquainted to call each other by our first names.
What was all this about Mr. Hartley bein’ missin’?”</p>

<p>“Nobody seems to know, Larry.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope he’s all right. Me and him are
waitin’ for the big wind to come along, so we can
fly a kite. When yore ankle gets better you can
help us.”</p>

<p>“All right, Larry. Perhaps your father will help,
too.”</p>

<p>Larry thought a while.</p>

<p>“Mebby. It’s funny to think of him bein’ my
father. Do you like him?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that, Larry?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he likes you.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you that?”</p>

<p>“He told me that the boss was a nice lady. He
wouldn’t say that unless he liked you, would he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure. I hope he likes me,
Larry.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, I’ve got to cut some wood.”</p>

<p>It was after twelve o’clock when Whispering beat
the dinner gong, and Sailor came up from the stable
with Larry. Whispering asked Nan whether they
should carry her to the table or serve her meal out
there. She decided in favour of eating on the porch.</p>

<p>It was Sailor who brought the tray out there.
Nan held it, while Sailor brought out a small table.</p>

<p>“You carried my message to Mr. Baggs, didn’t
you, Sailor?” she asked, still holding the tray in
both hands.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I didn’t,” he said. “Couldn’t find
him last night, and I plumb forgot to tell yuh this
mornin’.”</p>

<p>The tray slipped from Nan’s fingers, struck on her
two knees and went upside down on the porch, the
dishes clattering down the steps. Her arms fell
limply to her sides and she sagged back in her chair,
her face turning white.</p>

<p>“My golly!” blurted Sailor. “Whatsa matter?
Yore ankle?”</p>

<p>For several moments Nan did not speak, while
Sailor watched her anxiously. Hearing the crash of
the dishes, Whispering and Larry came running out.</p>

<p>“I reckon her ankle hurt,” said Sailor.</p>

<p>“You prob’ly stepped on it!” snorted Whispering.</p>

<p>“Aw, I wasn’t near her. She⸺”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” whispered Nan painfully. “Oh,
I’m sorry about the dishes.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, that’s all right,” assured Whispering.
“I’ll load up another bunch for yuh.”</p>

<p>Nan shook her head wearily.</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that, Whispering; I’m not
hungry now.”</p>

<p>“I know how yuh feel,” he said. “I had a
sprained leg once. Them pains shore do shoot
through. You jist take it easy, and when yuh get
hungry I’ll fix up a snack for yuh.”</p>

<p>They went back to the dining-room, leaving Nan
to stare out at the hills, wondering what would
happen next. She knew that Baggs would watch
for her to leave Lobo Wells, and when she did not
appear at the station he would have her arrested.</p>

<p>Several times Whispering came out to the porch,
anxious to prepare a meal for her, but she had no
appetite. Her eyes ached from watching the road
to Lobo Wells, and when she did see a cloud of
dust, presaging the approach of a rider, she clenched
her hands and swore she would be game, while cold
chills raced up and down her spine.</p>

<p>She recognised Len at a distance, but the other
rider was not familiar, until they came in through
the big gate, when she recognised the huge figure of
Ben Dillon, the sheriff. She gripped the arms of her
chair and watched them ride up to her and dismount.
The sheriff was coming for her, she knew.
Len’s face seemed very grave, as he said:</p>

<p>“Ben, you’ve met Miss Singer, ain’t yuh?”</p>

<p>“Howdy,” said the sheriff. “I ain’t never had
the pleasure.”</p>

<p>Nan couldn’t speak. Their faces seemed blurred.</p>

<p>“You remember sendin’ Sailor Jones to town
last night?” asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Hey!” blurted Len quickly. “She’s fainted,
Ben.”</p>

<p>“By God, that’s what she’s done, Len! What do
yuh do for⸺”</p>

<p>Len picked her up in his arms and carried her
into the house, placing her on the couch.</p>

<p>“What’s the hell’s been goin’ on now?” wailed
Whispering.</p>

<p>“Get some cold water!” snapped Len.</p>

<p>Len bathed her face with cold water, which revived
her in a few moments. Her mind was clear again,
and she waited for the sheriff to say or do something,
but he walked from the room with Len.
Out on the porch he said:</p>

<p>“She ain’t in no shape to talk, Len. Personally,
I don’t think Sailor had anythin’ to do with it, but
Breezy said that Sailor was along about that time,
and I jist wanted to kinda find out if she knew what
time he got home.”</p>

<p>“I told yuh she didn’t, Ben. Sailor never went
up to the house after he got back. It was only a
little while before Stevens and Breezy came bustin’
out, lookin’ for Hashknife. Anyway, Sailor wouldn’t
bushwhack anybody, and yuh say that Hartley was
bushwhacked.”</p>

<p>“Hartley never said anythin’—it was Breezy.
Sleepy told him. I saw Hartley this mornin’, and
he shore had a close call. It’s got me all balled up.
If you can tell me why anybody would try to shoot
his head off with a shotgun I’ll put in with yuh.
Why, the man is a stranger around here.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s true, Ben. Kinda funny. First off
they kill Prentice; then they try to kill Amos Baggs.
Now they ambush Hartley. Who will be next?
What did Hartley say?”</p>

<p>“Grinned like a danged fool. I asked him if he
wasn’t scared, and he said he shore was—scared to
death.”</p>

<p>Len smiled and rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>“Yuh say they threw him off the bridge?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Prob’ly thought he was dead.”</p>

<p>“Hm-m-m. I wonder if Hartley has any idea
who done it, Ben?”</p>

<p>“I asked Stevens the same question, and he said
he didn’t. I told Hartley I was goin’ to try and
find out who shot him, and he said he’d be much
obliged if I could. Sometimes he makes me so
damn mad, with his grinnin’—but yuh can’t help
likin’ him, Len. And he ain’t a man I’d choose for
a fight.</p>

<p>“Packs his gun pretty low,” nodded Len, “and
them eyes of his are pretty steady, even when he
grins with his mouth.”</p>

<p>“How’s the boy, Len?”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be driftin’ back. Sorry I bothered
Miss Singer, Len; but this deal is gittin’ me up in
the air.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Ben.”</p>

<p>Len Ayres watched him ride away, and then went
back into the house. Nan was curled up on the
couch.</p>

<p>“Where is the sheriff?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, he went back to town, Nan. He said he was
sorry to bother yuh, but there was a few things he
wanted to know. Last night somebody tried to kill
Hartley on the road between here and town. Shot
him off his horse and threw him in the river. Sailor
was the only man along the road at that time.
Breezy Hill knew what time Sailor left town, and
the sheriff wanted to see if you had any idea what
time Sailor got back here to the ranch. I guess he
didn’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t see Sailor after he got back last
night,” said Nan wearily.</p>

<p>“That’s what I told him. Do yuh feel better,
Nan?”</p>

<p>“Much better.”</p>

<p>“Ankle pretty sore, ain’t it? I’ll betcha. Mebby
I better take yuh to the doctor, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Well, that—yes, Len, that would give me a
chance to talk with Mr. Baggs. He expected me this
morning. Sailor never delivered my message to
him. I guess he wasn’t able to find Mr. Baggs.”</p>

<p>“Shore. But I’ll tell yuh what we’re goin’ to do,
Nan: we’re goin’ to take yore case away from
Baggs. I don’t trust him. We’ll demand the will
and all the papers and turn ’em over to another
lawyer. Jist cut Mr. Baggs off at the pockets.”</p>

<p>Nan stared at him rather wildly. The idea was
good, but the consequences might be terrible. She
thought quickly.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know whether I could stand the ride,
Len,” she said weakly. “This ankle is awful sore.
Maybe you better have the doctor come out here.”</p>

<p>“Whatever yuh want to do, Nan. Shall I bring
Baggs out?”</p>

<p>“We—we’ll let him—I’ll be all right in a few
days. You just tell him I got hurt, will you, Len?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore.”</p>

<p>After Len left the room Nan wiped the perspiration
off her brow and offered up a prayer for this
short respite. If Len explained her condition to
Baggs it might save her for a few more days.</p>

<h2 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI: AN ULTIMATUM</h2>

<p>Hashknife, with seven stitches in his scalp, and
bandaged like a turbaned Moslem, was around town,
minus his hat. Questions came thick and fast, but
he told everybody that it was a mystery to him.
He fingered the derringer in his pocket, and wondered
whether it belonged to Jack Pollock, who was
around the Oasis, still wearing his arm in a sling.
Pollock—if he were really Evans—had used a
derringer in Redfields. The gun did not bear any
identifying mark, and was small enough to conceal
in the palm of a man’s hand.</p>

<p>Hashknife tried to remember the two voices he
had heard, but the memory was too vague, the
voices seemingly too far away, although he could
remember what was said. But he decided that the
approach of Sailor Jones had hurried them and they
had thrown him over the railing of the bridge on
the spur of the moment, when otherwise they might
have been more critical of his real condition.</p>

<p>Amos Baggs was a little more than just upset that
day. He had been to the depot and seen the last
train of the day go through to the West, and Nan
had not been at the depot. He swore bitterly and
went back to his office, trying to think what to do
next. He was sure that Len had advised her to
stay, in spite of his warning.</p>

<p>If he had seen Len Ayres when the puncher rode
up to the front of his office he would have beaten
a retreat out through the back door, but he didn’t
have time. Len did not waste words, but delivered
Nan’s message as briefly as possible. And Amos
Baggs almost hugged Len Ayres. The weight of
the world lifted from his shoulders.</p>

<p>Len met Hashknife a little later and told him
about it, after they had discussed the events of the
night before.</p>

<p>“I dunno what struck Baggs,” said Len. “He
was so sour and so scared when I went in, and as
soon as I told him about Nan sprainin’ her ankle he
got real happy. I don’t figure him.”</p>

<p>“That’s a queer thing to make anybody happy.”</p>

<p>“Shore is.”</p>

<p>“What was the message?”</p>

<p>“That she had been hurt and wouldn’t be able
to see him to-day.”</p>

<p>Hashknife didn’t tell Ayres what he had read in
the letter from Baggs to Nan, but he knew that
Nan lost no time in coming in to see Baggs.</p>

<p>“There’s somethin’ wrong in that end of the
deal,” he told himself. “Nice girl and a crooked
lawyer. He’s got her scared, I think. I wish I had
her scared enough to talk. I’ll just about fool
around here until somebody blows my head off.”</p>

<p>Sleepy had the same idea.</p>

<p>“It ain’t worth it,” he declared. “Wire Wells
Fargo that we’re off the job, Hashknife. It was a
foolish idea, in the first place. They can’t expect
us to do anythin’. I’ll be darned if I think Len
Ayres has got that money planted.”</p>

<p>“Yuh don’t? Ain’t it funny—neither do I!”</p>

<p>“Fine! So what’s the use of stickin’ around
here, lookin’ for somethin’ that neither of us believe
exists.”</p>

<p>“Sleepy,” seriously, “what do yuh reckon they’re
shootin’ at me for?”</p>

<p>“That question can’t be answered. And if we
stick around here much longer it never will—by us.”</p>

<p>But Hashknife made no move to leave Lobo
Wells. For the next couple of days he stayed close
to town, waiting for his wounds to heal and being
sure not to acquire any fresh ones.</p>

<p>Out at the Box S, Nan’s ankle was nearly well
again. Much of the arguing between Whispering
and Sailor had ceased, because Larry was cutting
the wood, much to the amusement of everybody.
His ideas of measurements were rather flexible, and
at times Whispering was obliged to take the wood
back and cut it again; but never when Larry might
be aware of it.</p>

<p>Came Saturday night and Sailor rode to Lobo
Wells with Len. Whispering had been complaining
about rheumatism for days, so he decided to stay
at the ranch. Nan had completely recovered the
use of her ankle. She had heard no more from Amos
Baggs, but she realised that there was no more to
hear. He had delivered his ultimatum, but had
been kind enough to allow her this extra time.</p>

<p>Little Larry went to bed early, thoroughly tired.
Whispering was down in the bunk-house, either in
bed or deep in a game of solitaire. Nan was reading
in the living-room when she heard a noise on the
porch. As she lowered her book the door opened
softly and in came Amos Baggs and Jack Pollock,
the gambler.</p>

<p>“We saw you through the window,” said Baggs
softly, “so we didn’t bother to knock.”</p>

<p>Pollock was looking at her with a curious
smile.</p>

<p>“Some difference between a hall bedroom in a
Frisco rooming house and ownership of a ranch like
this,” he said. “Kid, I’ll give you credit; you’ve
got plenty of nerve. Too bad you didn’t get away
with it.”</p>

<p>Nan did not answer him. Baggs came up to the
table and removed some papers from his pocket,
which he spread on the table at her elbow. He took
out a fountain pen and handed it to her.</p>

<p>“Just sign on that lower line,” he said, indicating
it with a bony forefinger. “Sign it Madge Singer.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” Nan managed to articulate at
last.</p>

<p>“Power of attorney,” said Baggs. “You just
sign it, young lady. I’ll need that to handle this
case. We’ve got to say that you are suddenly called
to Frisco.”</p>

<p>“I—I’d rather not sign it now,” she said.</p>

<p>“<i>You’d</i> rather not sign it now? What have you
got to do with it, I’d like to know? You sign it.
I’ve been pretty lenient with you, young lady; now
you play square with me. Write your name on
that line, and let’s get this over.”</p>

<p>Nan looked at Pollock, who was grinning at her.
Baggs had been drinking, and his face was close
to her.</p>

<p>“You say I’m going back to Frisco?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That’s none of your damn business,” Baggs said
coldly. “You were an impostor. I’m merely saving
you from jail. You’re not entitled to that much
consideration, but I’m giving it to you. You sign
Madge Singer’s name on that line, write a note to
Len Ayres, telling him that you are suddenly called
away, and we’ll all get out of here. You’ll either
do this or stay in jail to-night.”</p>

<p>“Does Ayres know your handwriting?” asked
Pollock.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he does,” said Nan weakly. She
turned to Amos Baggs. “I guess I’d rather go to
jail,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’re seventeen kinds of a fool!” snorted
Baggs angrily.</p>

<p>Pollock was busy writing in a notebook. He tore
out the page, and his eyes were hard as he looked
at Nan.</p>

<p>“Let her go to jail, Amos,” he said. “She better
take her stuff along, because she’s going to stay a
long time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pack my stuff,” said Nan firmly.</p>

<p>“With us watching you,” declared Baggs.
“You’re too slippery, young lady. You’ve given
us plenty trouble already. Hurry up; we want to
get there before the jail closes for the night.”</p>

<p>Pollock laughed harshly, and then went to help
her pack.</p>

<h2 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII: SOMETHING WRONG</h2>

<p>Sunday was not a busy day in Lobo Wells. Hashknife
and Sleepy were at the livery stable, taking
care of their own horses, while the stable-keeper
was looking after the rest of the stock. As he led
a pair of horses past the stall where Hashknife kept
his gray he said to Hashknife:</p>

<p>“I think you lost yore pocket-book last night. I
picked one up near yore stall this mornin’. It’s
back there on the grain box.”</p>

<p>“All right,” grunted Hashknife, wondering what
the man meant. Hashknife never carried a pocket-book
in his life.</p>

<p>He hung up his currycomb and walked back to
the grain-box, where he found a leather billfold.
Inside it were twenty dollars in currency, some
personal cards of people he did not know—mostly
San Francisco people—and two tickets from Lobo
Wells to San Francisco.</p>

<p>There was no owner’s name, but Hashknife was
satisfied that it belonged to Jack Pollock. He put
it in his pocket, intending to turn it in at the Oasis.
The stable-keeper was out watering horses, when he
and Sleepy left the stable, so Hashknife did not
get a chance to speak to him about the billfold.</p>

<p>As Hashknife and Sleepy walked up the street
toward the hotel, Len Ayres rode in. He tied his
horse at the Oasis, but came directly across the
street to them.</p>

<p>“How are yuh this mornin’?” said Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet, Hartley. Take a look at
this.”</p>

<p>Len handed Hashknife a sheet from a notebook,
on which was pencilled in a rather delicate
hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='ni'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Ayres</span>,—I
have just received an
urgent message to come at once to San Francisco,
so I’m leaving now for Lobo Wells. You will hear
from me later.</p>

<div style='text-align:right; margin-right:4em'>“Sincerely,</div>
<div style='text-align:right;'>“<span class='sc'>Madge Singer</span>.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>“What’s wrong about that?” asked Hashknife
curiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Len rather lamely.
“It don’t look right to me, Hartley. She didn’t say
anythin’ about⸺”</p>

<p>“Baggs went out after her, while you were here
in town last night, eh?” Hashknife took it for
granted that Baggs was the messenger.</p>

<p>“Whisperin’ found this note on the table this
mornin’.”</p>

<p>“She’s probably got an urgent message, as she
says in the note. I don’t see anythin’ wrong with
it, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe it’s all right. In the first place, she always
calls me Len, and in the second place, I call her
Nan. Why did she use ‘Mr. Ayres’ and ‘Madge
Singer’?”</p>

<p>Hashknife was inclined to smile.</p>

<p>“You might ask Baggs about it,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll do just that.”</p>

<p>Len went on up the street to Baggs’s office, while
Hashknife and Sleepy crossed the street to the
Oasis. Harry Cole was at the bar and invited them
to have a drink. The place was nearly empty.</p>

<p>“How’s yore head this mornin’?” asked Cole,
as he filled his glass.</p>

<p>“Head’s all right,” smiled Hashknife. “Have a
big play last night?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good for the middle of the month.”</p>

<p>“Pollock around this mornin’?” Hashknife
intended giving him the billfold.</p>

<p>“Pollock left on the eleven-thirty train for
Frisco last night.”</p>

<p>“Thasso?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he decided to pull out. Lobo Wells ain’t
big enough for Pollock. He got smashed up in an
accident in Frisco, so he came up here for a trip.
I didn’t know you’d met him.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t,” dryly. “Anybody else go west with
him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. What made yuh think they
had?”</p>

<p>“Miss Singer went to Frisco on that same train.”</p>

<p>“Did she? I don’t think she knows Pollock.”</p>

<p>Hashknife and Sleepy left the saloon and walked
up to the depot. The depot agent happened to be
a genial sort of person, with plenty of time on his
hands.</p>

<p>“You don’t sell many tickets, do yuh?” asked
Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Not very many; why?”</p>

<p>“Remember sellin’ two one-way tickets to San
Francisco lately?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday. A gambler from the Oasis, the one
with the bum arm. Said he was goin’ out on the
eleven-thirty.”</p>

<p>“Was you on duty when that train pulled out?”</p>

<p>“Sure. But I didn’t see who got on. Didn’t pay
any attention.”</p>

<p>“What time did he buy the tickets?”</p>

<p>“In the mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know the name of the conductor
on that train?”</p>

<p>“Sure—Tony Lawton. Train 63.”</p>

<p>“Gimme a telegraph blank, and you can send
this where it’ll catch him as quick as yuh can.”</p>

<p>Hashknife wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='ni'>“Did you pick up two people at Lobo Wells last
night who had lost tickets and paid cash. Wire at
once.—<span class='sc'>Ben Dillon</span>, Sheriff.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The agent squinted at it curiously.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he smiled, “but you’re not the
sheriff.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; he’ll get the answer, pardner.”</p>

<p>“Sure—that’s right. I’ll catch Tony right away.”</p>

<p>And the agent was as good as his word. Within
an hour he was at the sheriff’s office with a telegram,
explaining to Ben Dillon that it was an answer to
the one a tall cowboy had sent.</p>

<p>“What tall cowboy?” asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what his name is. He signed your
name to the one he sent.”</p>

<p>The sheriff opened it and read this message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='ni'>“No passengers from Lobo Wells last night.</p>
<div style='text-align:right;'>“<span class='sc'>Tony Lawton.</span>”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>The sheriff’s face twisted thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Tall cowboy with a bandage on his head?”</p>

<p>“That’s the one. I forgot the bandage.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll keep it for him.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the sheriff left his office, and
as he started up the street he saw Hashknife talking
with Amos Baggs in front of a store. He walked up
and held out the telegram to Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I reckon this is the answer to one you sent,”
Dillon said. “It says there weren’t any passengers
from Lobo Wells last night. What does it mean?”</p>

<p>Hashknife took the telegram, scanned it and put
it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Who’s Tony Lawton?” queried the sheriff.</p>

<p>“He’s the man who signed this telegram. Thanks,
Dillon.”</p>

<p>Hashknife left them abruptly and started for the
livery stable. Amos Baggs had a queer expression
in his eyes as he watched the retreating back of the
tall cowpuncher.</p>

<p>“He’s got me beat,” declared the sheriff. “Signin’
my name to a telegram, and not even explainin’ the
answer. He’s shore got plenty nerve.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny he didn’t explain it,” said Baggs.</p>

<p>“That’s right. It said: ‘No passengers from
Lobo Wells last night,’ and was signed by a man
named Tony Lawton. Mebbe it was one of them
code messages. They usually sound queer.”</p>

<p>“That’s probably what it was,” agreed Amos.
“If you knew what was in the message he sent, you
might understand this reply.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it don’t make any difference, anyway. Did
somebody leave Lobo Wells on the train last night?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Baggs. “I go to bed
before the train arrives here.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was a code message,” decided the
sheriff, “but what a danged cowpuncher would be
sendin’ a code message for is more than I can make
out. He’s gettin’ too darn fresh, usin’ my name on
his telegrams; an’ when I see him, he’ll hear about
it.”</p>

<h2 id='chXXIII'>CHAPTER XXIII: BAGGS TAKES CHARGE</h2>

<p>Hashknife picked up Sleepy at the livery stable,
and they rode out to the Box S. Sleepy didn’t know
what it was all about, but he went willingly. They
found Len and Larry on the front porch.</p>

<p>“Do you think there’s enough wind to sail that
kite to-day, Mr. Hartley?” called the boy anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to wait a while, Larry.
Take a look at this, Len.”</p>

<p>He handed Len the answer to the telegram,
explaining that he had wired the conductor on the
train.</p>

<p>“I’d have bet on my hunch!” snapped Len.
“That proves it. But where is she, Hartley?
Nobody saw her leave. All we’ve got to go on is
the note she left.”</p>

<p>“Do you know her writin’, Len?”</p>

<p>“Never saw it in my life.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she didn’t write it. Maybe she didn’t
go away with Baggs. But there’s one cinch bet:
she didn’t board that train last night in Lobo Wells.
Jack Pollock, the gambler, is missin’, and Harry
Cole says he left on that eleven-thirty train for
Frisco. But this mornin’ the stable-keeper found
a billfold, which looks as though it belonged to
Pollock, and in it is two one-way tickets from Lobo
Wells to San Francisco. Pollock bought the two
tickets yesterday mornin’.”</p>

<p>“For gosh sakes!” blurted Len. “I’ll say you’ve
found out a lot.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do us much good. What we want to
know is this: did Pollock intend takin’ the girl
with him last night; and what became of them?
Do yuh know if she was acquainted with Pollock?”</p>

<p>“I never heard her say.”</p>

<p>“Did you talk with Amos Baggs about her goin’
away?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find him, Hartley; his office was
locked.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s still in town. That damn fool sheriff
read the answer to that telegram right in front of
him. Some folks never will have any brains, and
it seems as though about the time they get elected
sheriff they lose all their natural sense.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Baggs knows somethin’?”</p>

<p>“He knows that we know the girl didn’t go away
last night, and that we know Pollock didn’t take
that train. It may not be of any interest to him
to know this—but he knows it, if it is.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea why this was done,
Hartley?”</p>

<p>“Nope; have you?”</p>

<p>Len shook his head wearily, but Hashknife had
a feeling that Len knew more than he was telling.
Whispering and Sailor came to them, seeking
information—Len had told them that he didn’t believe
Nan wrote the note—and now he told them that
Nan did not leave on that eleven-thirty train from
Lobo Wells.</p>

<p>“Yuh don’t mean to say that somebody kidnapped
her, do yuh?” asked Whispering. “Wouldn’t
nobody do that?”</p>

<p>“There’s always somebody that’ll do <i>anythin’</i>,”
declared Sailor. “We ain’t had a first-class hangin’
for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Catch a rabbit before yuh skin him,” grunted
Whispering. “The worst of it is, this must have
happened while I’m down at the bunk-house last
night.”</p>

<p>“We left yuh here to guard her,” said Sailor.</p>

<p>“You left me here ’cause I had rheumatism, yuh
mean. Nobody told me to ride herd on her.”</p>

<p>“Well, boys, it couldn’t be helped,” sighed Len.
“There’s no blame comin’ to anybody. Mebby
everythin’ is all right. I guess I’ll go to town and
have a talk with Baggs,” and then savagely: “And
he’ll talk to me, or I’ll saw off his damn ears.”</p>

<p>“That would be my idea of a holiday,” grinned
Whispering as Len hurried down to the stable to
get his horse.</p>

<p>“Why does everybody hate Baggs?” asked
Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” confessed Whispering. “I hate him
for the things he said about Len at the trial. Old
Harmony Singer hated him a-plenty. I had to talk
pretty strong to keep Harmony from killin’ him. He
shore was a tough old feller.”</p>

<p>“Singer was dragged to death, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Whispering nodded sadly.</p>

<p>“They didn’t make ’em better,” said Sailor.</p>

<p>“You knew Len’s wife?” Hashknife queried.</p>

<p>“Shore,” nodded Whispering quickly. “She
didn’t shoot square.”</p>

<p>“Before he was sent up?”</p>

<p>Whispering and Sailor exchanged quick glances,
and Whispering cleared his throat harshly.</p>

<p>“Afterward,” he said huskily.</p>

<p>Len was riding up from the stable, and the three
of them went back to Lobo Wells. Len was plainly
worried.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say to Baggs,” he confessed,
as they neared the town.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” advised Hashknife. “Just tell
him that she went away without leavin’ any orders,
and see what he has to say about it. No use rubbin’
him the wrong way. Don’t let him know that yuh
suspect anythin’ wrong.”</p>

<p>“That might be best; I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>But Len got the surprise of his life when he went
to see Baggs in his office. The lawyer was inclined
to be dictatorial.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know where Miss Singer went,” he
said. “She left a note under my door sayin’ she
was leavin’ for San Francisco and might not be back.”</p>

<p>He produced the note, written in the same hand
and on the same kind of paper as the one she had
left for Len.</p>

<p>“She didn’t tell me she might not be back,” said
Len.</p>

<p>“Well, she told me. And, another thing, Ayres:
I have power of attorney to run the Box S until
she returns. Miss Singer signed the paper several
days ago. If you want to see it⸺”</p>

<p>“Gave you power of attorney to run the Box S?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And I’m going to run it, Ayres. You
are through as foreman, and you can notify Taylor
and Jones that they are also through.”</p>

<p>Len stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>“Kinda sudden, ain’t yuh?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“Not at all. You and your men move out, and
I’ll hire a new crew. It has been done before, so
I’m not setting any precedent. I have explained to
the sheriff just what I intend to do; so the less you say
or do about it the better it will be for you, Ayres.”</p>

<p>Len was mad. He wanted to take that skinny
neck between his two hands and squeeze real hard.
But he was forced to admit that Baggs had the
whip hand.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll sign and cash that thousand
dollar cheque now?” said Len slowly.</p>

<p>“If it suits me—yes. I have the right.”</p>

<p>Len studied the situation for a while. Then he
said slowly:</p>

<p>“She’ll have to come back to have that will
probated.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. She has been established here,
and if it is impossible for her to be present—well,
it is merely a matter of legal procedure. I don’t think
the court will even raise a question.”</p>

<p>“Another friend of yours pulled out on the same
train last night, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Who was that?”</p>

<p>“Pollock.”</p>

<p>“Did he? I didn’t know it. Why do you say
he’s a friend of mine, Ayres?”</p>

<p>“I heard he was.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe everything you hear, Ayres.”</p>

<p>“Who brought Miss Singer to town last night?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Can’t or won’t, Baggs?”</p>

<p>“I think that will be about all. If you will
make out the pay-roll for yourself and the other
two men I’ll give you a cheque for it. Be off the
Box S by to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>Len stifled an impulse to manhandle Baggs and
left the office. Hashknife, Sleepy and Breezy were
sitting on the sidewalk in front of the sheriff’s office,
and Len went down to them. He drew Hashknife
aside and told him what Baggs had done, while
Hashknife whistled unmusically between his teeth.</p>

<p>“Showed you the note she left under his door,
eh?” mused Hashknife. “She shore sneaked fast,
Len. But where did she go from there? Who
brought her to town? I felt sure that Baggs went
out after her, but I just asked the man at the stable,
and he said that Pollock was the only man who
hired a rig from him last night.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Pollock person, anyway?” asked
Len. “He came here after I went away.”</p>

<p>“Flash gambler, from Frisco. Unless I’m mistaken,
his name used to be Evans, and he’s wanted
for killin’. Looks to me like a slick-fingered killer.
They tell me he used to work for Harry Cole of
the Oasis. Cole told me that Pollock got busted up
in a wreck in Frisco and was out here visitin’ while
his arm healed up.”</p>

<p>“Hartley, do you think Nan ran away with
Pollock?”</p>

<p>Hashknife studied Len’s face for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Len,” he said softly, “is this anxiety merely for
the boss of the Box S, or is it⸺”</p>

<p>“I’m just a plain damn fool!” said Len savagely.
“I’ve been a fool ever since I came back here. I
suppose,” he added bitterly, “I’ll keep on bein’ a
fool all my life.”</p>

<p>“And they are legion,” sighed Hashknife.</p>

<p>“What did you say, Hartley?”</p>

<p>“I just said that we’re in the majority.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh—I suppose. Well, I hate to go out
and break the news to Whispering and Sailor.
They’ve lived there for years; sorta pensioned by
Harmony. They’ll want to come in and kill Baggs.
And, Hartley, I’m afraid it will require the sheriff
to shake ’em loose from the Box S. I can land
another job, but they can’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, he gave yuh until to-morrow night,
didn’t he? Kingdoms have changed hands in
shorter time than that. I’m goin’ up to my room
and do a lot of thinkin’. And I’ve got a hunch
that Nan didn’t run away with Pollock.”</p>

<p>“I hope yo’re right, Hartley. I’ll see what I
can think about before I see yuh again.”</p>

<p>Hashknife went up to his room and sprawled on
the bed.</p>

<p>“Of all the snake trails I ever follered, this is
the worst,” he told himself. “What’s it all about,
anyway? There’s one cinch bet, and that is that
somebody around here is scared of me, and I don’t
know what for.”</p>

<p>He reviewed the killing of Charley Prentice, who
had been sober and industrious until Len Ayres
came back. What was Prentice afraid of, he wondered?
Was it because he had married Len’s
ex-wife? Did he fear Len’s wrath so much that he
drank himself to a physical wreck?</p>

<p>The evidence of little Larry would indicate that
the man or men who killed Prentice wanted to
throw the blame on Len. And would they commit
murder merely to get Len out of the way? That
was hardly reasonable, Hashknife decided. Did
they want to close Prentice’s mouth, and at the
same time dispose of Len? That sounded reasonable.
Drunken men might talk.</p>

<p>For at least two hours the tall cowboy sprawled
on the bed, his gray eyes blinking at the bare ceiling,
until Sleepy came up and demanded to know whether
Hashknife was playing a joke on his stomach or
had he forgotten that it was past supper time.</p>

<p>Hashknife got up and washed his face in the
cracked porcelain bowl. He placed his sombrero
atop his bandages and did a few clumsy dance
steps on the creaking floor, after which he sang
softly:</p>

<blockquote>

<div>“When my engine roars down through the cut,</div>
<div style='text-indent:2em;'>I’ll tell yuh what to do:</div>
<div>If my darlin’s dead, just show the red;</div>
<div style='text-indent:2em;'>If she bet-ter-r-r, show the blue.”</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Sleepy looked at him curiously. It was not often
that Hashknife sang a song—for which Sleepy was
duly thankful, because Hashknife was not exactly
a vocalist. But Sleepy knew that when Hashknife
sang, even a short part of a verse, it was because he
had solved something.</p>

<p>“What do yuh know?” asked Sleepy curiously.</p>

<p>Hashknife grinned softly and looked at himself in
the old mirror.</p>

<p>“I know it’s time to eat, cowboy. Glad yuh
reminded me.”</p>

<p>They found Ben Dillon and Breezy eating their
supper; so they sat down at the same table. The
sheriff masticated rapidly for several moments, his
eyes on Hashknife. Then:</p>

<p>“Hartley, I’d like to have yuh tell me what that
telegram meant. I’m not in the habit of lettin’
folks use my name on telegrams, the same of which
I don’t know anythin’ about. The darn thing don’t
make sense. You ain’t never showed me jist who
yuh are, and—well, what about it?”</p>

<p>Hashknife smiled across the table at the sheriff,
who grunted audibly, but waited for Hashknife to
speak.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay for the telegram,” said Hashknife.</p>

<p>“That part don’t interest me none; I want to
know what it was all about.”</p>

<p>Hashknife did not smile now. He looked at the
sheriff with his level gray eyes, as he said softly:
“I can’t tell yuh now, sheriff. Too many cooks
always spoil the broth.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?” thoughtfully. “Well, you got a nerve,
Hartley. Oh, it’s O.K. with me if all this is on the
square.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I give you my word.”</p>

<p>Baggs had talked to the sheriff, telling him that
he was firing the crew at the Box S, and saying
that he might have some trouble over it.</p>

<p>“Kinda tough,” agreed Breezy, digging away at
a tough steak with a dull knife. “Len’s got the kid
to look after, too. Mebby he’ll rent the Prentice
house and start housekeepin’. Be funny if he did,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Did Prentice own the house?” asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Belongs to Harry Cole,” said the sheriff.
“Prentice rented from him.”</p>

<p>“Mebby Baggs will give us a job on the Box S,”
grinned Sleepy.</p>

<p>“Stranger things than that have happened,”
grunted Breezy.</p>

<p>“Shore,” grinned Hashknife. “I remember
readin’ about the sea openin’ up and lettin’ the
Hebrews go through dry-shod.”</p>

<p>“I never swallered that,” choked Breezy. “Must
’a’ been plenty mud. I don’t believe in mi-rackles,
but the jigger that served this steak shore does.
Hey, Charley! Take this steak back and try it on
the next customer. I know when I’m whipped.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like taste?” inquired the Chinaman.</p>

<p>“Boy, I never got that far. Gimme some aigs.”</p>

<p>“Yessa.”</p>

<p>Hashknife turned to the sheriff, who was grinning.</p>

<p>“Pollock went away last night, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he went away on the⸺” The sheriff
hesitated as he remembered the wording of that
telegram. “I heard he did,” he finished rather
lamely. “What about him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Pollock, Hartley?”</p>

<p>“Never met the gent in my life.”</p>

<p>“Then why are you so interested in him?”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so much the man as it is the things he
does.”</p>

<p>“What’s he done?”</p>

<p>Hashknife paused with a forkful of food short of
his lips. “<i>Quién sabe?</i>” he said softly.</p>

<h2 id='chXXIV'>CHAPTER XXIV: EVICTED</h2>

<p>“Well, I ain’t goin’ to git off. Harmony Singer told
me that this was my home, didn’t he? No danged
weasel-faced lawyer is goin’ to hoodle me out of
my home. My work is sat’sfact’ry, and I stay here.
Let him come out here. What do I care? I’ll jist
pistol-whip him and retain m’ position. That’s me,
all the time.”</p>

<p>Sailor Jones leaned back from the breakfast table
at the Box S and glared at the red-faced Whispering,
who was baking hot cakes. Across the table from
Sailor sat Larry, his plate piled high with steaming
cakes.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m about full,” the boy announced.</p>

<p>“Yuh ain’t full,” declared Whispering. “Yuh
can’t be full of jist sixteen hot cakes. Eat up them
five, and I’ll have some fresh ones for yuh. You
satisfied, Sailor?”</p>

<p>“Got enough cakes—yeah.”</p>

<p>“Kinda puny, ain’t yuh? You only et ten this
mornin’.”</p>

<p>“That lawyer took away my appetite. Mebby I
better ride in and kill him. I’ll betcha I’d be
thanked.”</p>

<p>“You’d be hung, you danged fool. Some few of
us might e-rect a monyment to yuh, Sailor; but
you wouldn’t know it. Git them killin’ notions out
of yore head. Len says to go easy.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, he does!” snored Sailor. “And he
never slept a wink last night. Looks like a complete
accident this mornin’. ’F I ain’t as dumb as a
horned toad, Len’s in love with Nan.”</p>

<p>“Yo’re crazy.”</p>

<p>“I can’t eat no more,” declared Larry at last.
“Twenty-one is plenty.”</p>

<p>He slipped off his chair, sighed deeply, and went
down to the stable to saddle his burro.</p>

<p>Sailor tilted his chair against the wall and rolled
a smoke.</p>

<p>“What’s yore idea of this Hartley, Whisperin’?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Len’s got faith in him. He shore dug
up evidence that Nan never left on that train. But
where’d she go? I’ll betcha she ran away with
that gambler. Wimmin,” Sailor exhaled deeply,
“are queer critters. I never understood ’em.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny, too,” grunted Whispering, “bein’
as you never had anythin’ to do with ’em.”</p>

<p>“I had a squaw wife once, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“Injuns are different, Sailor.”</p>

<p>Whispering sat down beside the table, resting his
chin on his hands.</p>

<p>“I dunno what we’re goin’ to do, Sailor. Me
and yuh have been together a long time, but I
dunno who in hell would ever hire us two old wrecks
together. We ain’t much good, that’s shore. Yuh
jist kinda git old all to once, without realisin’ it,
and nobody wants yuh.”</p>

<p>“I’m three years younger than you are, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“To hear you tell it—yeah. But yo’re too old,
Sailor. We’ve got to look at this straight. There’s
no jobs for us in this country. I might git on as a
cook on some outfit—if they needed one awful bad.
I can’t ride no more. You can’t even cook. Dang
it, Sailor, we’re jist a couple of old derelicts. If
we’d fought in the wars, instead of hidin’ in the
brush, we could go to a home for soldiers.”</p>

<p>“I never hid in no brush, dang yuh! I was too
young to go to war.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t speakin’ about the Rev’lutionary War,
Sailor.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I fought Injuns. Me and them
Apaches⸺”</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam ain’t offerin’ a home to fellers who
fought to save their own lives.”</p>

<p>“I’m not askin’ him for a home, dang it!”</p>

<p>“You probably will be.”</p>

<p>Len came and sat down in the doorway. His
gray-green eyes were bloodshot this morning and his
hair hadn’t been combed.</p>

<p>“We’ll go in this afternoon, boys,” he said
slowly. “I’ll get the money from Baggs. Don’t
get drunk and act foolish. Save yore money this
time.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s good advice, Len,” agreed
Whispering. “We’ll need our money now. What’ll
you do, Len—you and the kid?”</p>

<p>Len shook his head.</p>

<p>“I wish we could stick together, Len.”</p>

<p>“I guess we will, Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“How can we do it?” asked Sailor quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Sailor.”</p>

<p>Len got quickly to his feet. Hashknife and
Sleepy were riding in off the main road. They came
up to the kitchen door and dismounted. Hashknife
was grinning widely as they came in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Smelled hot cakes,” he said. “How’s chances
for some?”</p>

<p>“The best yuh ever seen,” said Whispering. He
grabbed for a handful of wood and stoked the fire.</p>

<p>“Look upon us, will yuh?” laughed Hashknife.
“Behold the new crew of the Box S!”</p>

<p>“What do yuh mean?” asked Len.</p>

<p>Hashknife chuckled as he sat down at the table.</p>

<p>“Gospel truth, Len. Amos Alexander Baggs
himself hired me and Sleepy this mornin’.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Shore did. Stipulated that we don’t keep none
of you boys. Yo’re all fired.”</p>

<p>“We was all fired last night,” said Sailor.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand Baggs,” said Len
slowly. “How did he ever select you two?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Hashknife, “is a question. Punchers
are scarce, I suppose. Anyway, he explained that
he needed us right away. Couldn’t seem to wait
until the boys left. Said he’d send out a load of
grub in a couple of days; so that was a gentle hint
to get on the job and stay on it.”</p>

<p>“No other news?” asked Len.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. Gee, you shore make hot cakes,
pardner. Wish we could keep yuh cookin’. Mebby
we can talk Baggs into hirin’ yuh in a few days.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right with me—if he’d take Sailor,
too.”</p>

<p>“Mebby we can fix it.”</p>

<p>“You take the job, if yuh can git it, Whisperin’,”
advised Sailor. “I’ll git along. Pers’nally, I don’t
know if I’d work for Baggs.”</p>

<p>“You’d work for me, wouldn’t yuh, Sailor?”
asked Hashknife.</p>

<p>“Yo’re dang well right!”</p>

<p>“Well, yuh may be back here sooner than yuh
think.”</p>

<p>“Thank yuh kindly, Hartley. I hope yo’re right.
This is home to me and Whisperin’.”</p>

<p>“There’s no place like home,” said Hashknife
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You re’lise it—when yo’re run out of it,” said
Whispering, and turned away, wiping the hot-cake
smoke out of his eyes.</p>

<p>“That damn smoke is kinda—kinda thick,” said
Sailor, and sauntered outside.</p>

<p>Hashknife and Len exchanged glances of complete
understanding. The smoke wasn’t at all distressing.</p>

<p>They loafed around the ranch all day. Len gave
Hashknife all the information regarding the details
of the ranch. Whispering cooked an early supper
for them. Sailor hitched up a team to the buckboard
to carry their belongings to Lobo Wells, and
they drove away at sundown.</p>

<p>Len looked back and waved at Hashknife and
Sleepy, but the two old men kept their eyes straight
ahead. They didn’t want to look back. There was
a suspicion of moisture in Hashknife’s eyes as he
turned away, but his lean jaw was set with determination.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sleepy expansively, “we’ve got a
job on our hands, Hashknife.”</p>

<p>“We shore have, pardner. Hope the god of luck
is with us. I’m still pawin’ in the dark, I tell yuh.
Just guessin’, guessin’, without a danged thing to
back me up. What do yuh do when yo’re holdin’
two deuces in a stiff poker game, Sleepy?”</p>

<p>“Think they’re a full house and play ’em hard.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doin’; prayin’ to a special
little god of mine—and bluffin’ like a fool. As soon
as it’s dark, we’ll saddle up and sneak back to
town.”</p>

<p>“Is this the end of the trail, Hashknife?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? I tell yuh, I’m bluffin’. I ain’t
even got a pair of deuces. But when the other feller
don’t know it⸺”</p>

<p>“Where does that girl come in on it, Hashknife?”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask her—if we’re lucky.”</p>

<h2 id='chXXV'>CHAPTER XXV: HASHKNIFE DOES SOME TRAILING</h2>

<p>“That’s a sweet job to give anybody! Whatsa
matter with yuh, Ben? Them two old jiggers
wouldn’t hurt anybody. I suppose old Baggs asked
yuh to detail me to dry-nurse ’em, eh?”</p>

<p>Breezy Hill rasped his spurred heel along the
side of Ben Dillon’s desk, giving vent to his displeasure.</p>

<p>“Demanded it,” grinned the sheriff. “Whisperin’
and Sailor are over at the Oasis, fillin’ their skins
with liquor, and I don’t hardly blame Baggs for
demandin’ protection. If I was in his place I’d
ask the Governor to send troops and proclaim
martial law.”</p>

<p>“Aw, they wouldn’t shoot him, Ben.”</p>

<p>“They won’t if we can stop ’em, Breezy. You
keep sober and stay close to ’em. Len’s got his kid
over at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I take a drink, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Sure, but stay sober.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shore. Say! What do yuh think about
Baggs hirin’ Hashknife and Sleepy to run the
Box S?”</p>

<p>“It’s the first sensible thing he’s ever done.
Thank gosh, we’re rid of ’em. I’ve been wishin’
they’d land a job.”</p>

<p>“I liked ’em,” said Breezy.</p>

<p>“Thasall right, Breezy; but they got to be
pests.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose. Well, I’ll go out and night-herd them
two old pelicans for yuh, Ben. But don’t ask too
much of me. I’m not so danged stuck on Amos
Alexander Baggs m’self.”</p>

<p>Not realising that Breezy was acting in an
official capacity, Whispering and Sailor welcomed
him with open arms. Len had drawn their wages
from Baggs, and they had already forgotten that
this was their last pay day at the Box S.</p>

<p>They bought Breezy a couple of drinks, which
was sufficient to organise the deputy to a point
where he began buying.</p>

<p>“We’re here,” said Whispering owlishly, “to
show a man the error of his ways, ain’t we, Sailor?”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Sailor heartily if thickly.
“We’ve dug up the hatchet and we’re packin’ a
red belt. Didja know we got throwed out of our
home, Breezy? Didja? Well, it’s a sholem fac’.
Throwed out in the cold world.”</p>

<p>It had been over a hundred in the shade that day,
so Breezy had little sympathy with that statement.
He nodded and turned his back to the bar, while
he surveyed the room. Several of the games were
going full blast, and at a poker table, only a few
feet away, sat Amos Alexander Baggs. He shifted
his eyes toward Breezy and nodded, possibly acknowledging
the guardianship.</p>

<p>Breezy turned back to the bar. The bartender
served some drinks at the poker game and when
he came back behind the bar he caught Breezy’s
eye, indicated the poker table with a jerk of his
head and said softly:</p>

<p>“You’ve got a drink coming, Breezy.”</p>

<p>He meant that Baggs had told him to serve a
drink to the deputy.</p>

<p>“All right, thanks,” Breezy replied. “Whatcha
havin’, boys?”</p>

<p>“Same thing,” said Whispering, and Sailor nodded.
The bartender tried to indicate that the order was
for one drink, but Breezy ignored it. So they all
had a drink on Amos Baggs.</p>

<p>Amos Baggs saw the old punchers drink and it
made him so mad he almost forgot to draw cards.
Breezy grinned gleefully. Unless these two old
rangers got too drunk to navigate, it promised to be
a big evening. Len came in, circled the opposite
side of the room to escape Whispering, Sailor and
Breezy, and sat down in another poker game, where
Harry Cole was doing the dealing.</p>

<p>More cowboys drifted in, until the range was
fairly well represented, and there was more or less
confusion. Whispering and Sailor grew loud in their
talk and just a little incoherent at times, but Breezy
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>It was about eight o’clock when Hashknife and
Sleepy rode in. They left their horses at the outskirts
of the town and came in behind the east side
of the main street. It was barely dark now. They
came in behind the Oasis saloon and sat down
against the side of an old shed.</p>

<p>There was a light in Harry Cole’s private office,
which had a rear entrance. To the left of this
entrance, twenty feet away, was the rear entrance
to the Oasis.</p>

<p>From where the pair sat they could hear some of
the noise in the saloon, the sound of people going
in and out of the place. Both Hashknife and Sleepy
had cultivated plenty of patience. They sat
there like a couple of images, invisible in the
dark.</p>

<p>Hashknife had warned Sleepy that they might
be there most of the night and Sleepy agreed that
it would be a nice night for it, not knowing what it
was all about—nor caring.</p>

<p>There was one building between the Oasis and a
Chinese restaurant, but even at that distance they
could hear the Chinese rattling dishes at the rear
of the restaurant.</p>

<p>It was after nine o’clock when Hashknife suddenly
touched Sleepy on the arm. Some one was coming
around from the rear of the restaurant. The figure
shuffled softly to the rear door of Cole’s office and
knocked gently several times. Finally the door
opened and they saw that it was a Chinese, carrying
a loaded tray, covered with a white cloth.</p>

<p>It was Harry Cole who opened the door. He took
the tray from the Chinese.</p>

<p>“I’ll send the tray back later, Charley,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yessa.”</p>

<p>Cole closed the door and the Chinese shuffled back
around the building. Hashknife sighed and relaxed.</p>

<p>“Some busy gambler will eat,” whispered Sleepy.</p>

<p>Hashknife did not reply. It was a common thing
for food to be brought to a gambling house, as many
players do not care to stop playing long enough to
go out and eat a meal. There had been a light
burning in Cole’s private room when the tray came,
but a few moments later the light was turned out.</p>

<p>It was so dark out there that all they could see
was the indistinct skyline of the building, the only
window in the rear of the Oasis being the one in
Cole’s room. About five minutes after the light had
vanished they heard the door open and close gently.
Came the sound of a man walking on the hard-packed
ground. He passed to the left of them,
evidently picking his way carefully in the dark.
Hashknife squeezed Sleepy’s arm sharply and
whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>“Stay where yuh are.”</p>

<p>Then he got to his feet, turned to the right around
the shed and ran swiftly on his toes, praying that
he might not kick a tin can or run into anything.
He had his bearings fairly well and it was easier to
see ahead as soon as he got away from the buildings.</p>

<p>He didn’t know where the man was, didn’t wait
to investigate further, but kept on running. Ahead
of him was the dark bulk of a house, and he halted
just in time to save himself from running into the
fence.</p>

<p>Over the fence he went, dropping to his hands
and knees, while he figured out his bearings. Then
he went cautiously ahead, his hands reaching out
in front of him, until he could touch the building.
Quickly he worked to the right, found the corner
and moved a few feet to the corner of the unrailed
porch. From where he stopped he could reach out
and touch the front door of the Prentice house.</p>

<p>Hashknife had been there possibly a full minute
when he heard the latch of the old gate click softly.
He slipped his gun loose, gripping it tightly and
stepped up on the edge of the porch. He could
hear the soft slither of gravel as the man came down
the walk.</p>

<p>He stopped a few feet away, and Hashknife took
a deep breath. He was afraid the man could see
him, but his fear was unfounded, for at that moment
the man whistled three soft notes. It sounded to
Hashknife like the first three notes in “Taps,” as
played by a bugler. Then the man came on boldly,
moving up the three or four steps to the top of the
porch.</p>

<p>He was within reach of Hashknife now, panting
slightly. He moved forward and something struck
Hashknife’s left elbow. A dish rattled.</p>

<p>“What in hell!” grunted the man.</p>

<p>There was no waiting now. Hashknife jerked
forward, struck in the direction of the man’s head,
and almost at the same time he reached out his left
hand. The swinging gun reached its mark, the man
grunted foolishly, and fell forward in to Hashknife,
forcing him back against the wall, and at that
moment the door opened behind Hashknife.</p>

<p>Came the clatter of falling dishes, smashing on the
porch, the rattle of the heavy tray, a sharp exclamation
of wonder from the doorway, and Hashknife
whirled and dived straight in through the doorway,
striking his left shoulder heavily as he came in.</p>

<p>He went to his knees, badly off balance, while
a revolver spurted a flame a foot above his body,
and the windows of the house danced from the
concussion. Again the spurt of orange-coloured
flame licked out through the darkness low enough
to have scorched him, but he had dropped flat on the
carpet.</p>

<p>Swiftly he rolled aside, his gun ready. A chair
rattled, echoed by the concussion of Hashknife’s
big gun, but only a shower of plaster attested the
hit. But in the flash of the exploding powder
Hashknife saw the man dart through the doorway
into the kitchen. Swiftly he shifted his gun and
fired again through the doorway.</p>

<p>Then he sprang to his feet in the darkness and
ran to the doorway, stepping aside quickly. Came
the slam of a closing door, a man’s swift step on
the back porch. Hashknife whirled and ran out
the front door. His boots crushed down on scattered
dishes and he almost fell off the porch, but he
regained his balance and stopped short. He heard
the fence creak from a weight, and then came the
sound of a man running swiftly.</p>

<p>A few steps carried him to the fence, which he
vaulted, and then he started running towards the
rear of the Oasis.</p>

<h2 id='chXXVI'>CHAPTER XXVI: A TALL BLUFF</h2>

<p>Things were not going so smoothly at the Oasis.
Sailor Jones had arrived at the point where he was
becoming unmanageable. He stood alone at the end
of the bar and dared anybody to touch him. Every
one in the saloon knew he was as drunk as a man
might become and still keep his feet, but to outward
appearances he was as sober as a judge.</p>

<p>And he was not to be ignored. Breezy tried to
get close enough to grab his gun, but failed. Sailor
was an old lobo wolf, drunk enough to imagine he
was cornered and ready to kill. He kept his little
bloodshot eyes upon Amos Baggs, who was perspiring
copiously.</p>

<p>“I’m gonna kill shomebody pretty quick,” he
said coldly.</p>

<p>The sheriff came over beside the bar and Sailor
gave him a venomous glance. Ben grimaced despairingly.
Amos caught his eye and indicated a strong
desire to commune with the sheriff. Sailor had
become the centre of attraction, it seemed. No one
wanted to injure the old man, and they knew it
would require drastic measures to stop him, so
their best bet was to let him alone until the whisky
reacted and put him down.</p>

<p>Len Ayres left his game and came over to the
bar, ten feet away from Sailor Jones.</p>

<p>“What are yuh drinkin’, Sailor?” he asked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t drinkin’,” sullenly. “Don’t nobody touch
me. I’m in the market for a scalp and I’m not
askin’ for much ha’r.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a dang fool, Sailor. Let’s have a good
time.”</p>

<p>“I’m havin’ a good time.”</p>

<p>The sheriff went over to Baggs, who whispered
earnestly. The sheriff frowned heavily, shook his
head. The other players seemed uneasy. Harry
Cole got up from his table and came over there,
keeping an eye on Sailor Jones.</p>

<p>Just a little, wizened old man, with deep-sunk
eyes and fox-tail hair, his collar hiked up around
his flaring ears, Sailor was almost mummylike in his
immobility, the palm of one skinny hand rubbing
the point of his hip above his holstered gun.</p>

<p>“Wash ’m, Shailor?” mumbled Whispering owlishly.
“I’m for yuh, ol’-tim’r. Bite ’m, Tige!”</p>

<p>“You shut up,” warned Breezy, who felt obliged
to show some authority.</p>

<p>“You shut me up, will yuh?” Whispering
straightened himself belligerently. “You try ’t!”</p>

<p>“My Gawd—you, too!” wailed Breezy. “I
guess we better wire for the troops.”</p>

<p>Baggs was getting up from his chair, shielding
himself with the sheriff. His idea was to get out
of there. Sailor laughed harshly, and snarled:</p>

<p>“Sher’f, you better pray along with Amos Baggs.”</p>

<p>The sheriff stopped; Baggs stopped. There was
not much of Baggs projecting outside the bulky
outlines of the sheriff, but Baggs didn’t know it.
Possibly he felt much larger than the sheriff.</p>

<p>“I—I never done anything to him,” wailed Amos.
His voice sounded thin and weak in the smoke-hazy
room.</p>

<p>“Sound yore A-string,” said Breezy foolishly.</p>

<p>“Sailor,” the sheriff’s voice was not too confident,
“if you start anythin’⸺”</p>

<p>But the sheriff didn’t finish his warning. A man
staggered in the front door; a man in his shirt
sleeves, blood running down the side of his face,
his mouth wide open, as though he had been running
a long ways. It was the man who did the cleaning
in the Oasis; the swamper, as he was called.</p>

<p>The menace of Sailor Jones was forgotten. The
man staggered and would have fallen, except that
the sheriff grasped his arm. Every one in the place
was on his feet now. Harry Cole came forward,
staring at the man.</p>

<p>“What in hell happened to you?” asked Breezy.</p>

<p>The man looked at Cole but did not speak. His
face was the colour of ashes, and he seemed about
to collapse.</p>

<p>“I’ll take him in my room,” said Cole quickly.
“No, I can handle him alone. Jerry, did you get
kicked by a horse?”</p>

<p>The swamper’s head sagged, but he did not reply.
Some one suggested getting a doctor. Baggs seemed
to forget Sailor Jones and came down past him,
watching Cole and the swamper going toward the
door of Cole’s private room.</p>

<p>Suddenly the back door opened and in came
Jack Pollock. It seemed as though he had tried
to make his entrance as inconspicuous as possible
and had run slap into the spotlight. He was without
a hat and minus his usual starched white collar.</p>

<p>Harry Cole had halted with the injured swamper
when Pollock made his abrupt entrance, and Pollock
came toward them, hardly knowing what else to do.
No one spoke. Pollock had not closed the door
behind him. He came close to Cole.</p>

<p>“Your door was locked,” he said, as though
explaining why he had entered the saloon.</p>

<p>Many of those present did not know Pollock was
supposed to be on his way to San Francisco. The
swamper was sagging like a drunken man and Cole
was trying to hold him up with one hand.</p>

<p>It was then that Hashknife Hartley stepped in
through the rear doorway, stopped short and looked
around. He was without a hat, his bandages
slightly askew. Pollock’s head jerked around and
he watched Hashknife from over his right shoulder.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’re all present,” said Hashknife
slowly. “Ah, there’s our old friend, Amos Baggs.
Yes, we’re all here and accounted for, gentlemen.
Sheriff’s here, deputy’s here. Len, are you here?”</p>

<p>“Over here, Hashknife!” called Len.</p>

<p>“Good boy! Len, take a look at Mr. Baggs and
Mr. Cole. These two men owe you five years—five
years of bustin’ rocks. Prentice was the third
member, but they killed him, because he might
talk. I’ve got ’em cinched so tight that any jury
on earth would hang ’em on my evidence alone!”</p>

<p>It was said in such a matter-of-fact way, so coldly
confident, that every one was stunned.</p>

<p>“They tried twice to kill me,” said Hashknife,
“because they knew I’d hang ’em higher than a
kite!”</p>

<p>Harry Cole’s right hand whipped in under his
coat and a blued Colt flashed from a shoulder
holster, but he was too slow, even with all his speed.
Hashknife fired once, and the shock of the heavy
bullet, striking Cole in the left shoulder, whirled
him on his heel and he went down flat, with the
sagging swamper falling half across him.</p>

<p>And almost at the same instant Sleepy, who
had entered the front door, came with a football
rush, folded both arms around the middle of Amos
Alexander Baggs, and they crashed down in the
middle of the floor, with Sleepy on top of him.</p>

<p>Pollock, who had jerked aside, seeking a way out,
possibly thinking that he had not been included,
was brought up short when Hashknife’s gun barrel
dug deeply into his ribs.</p>

<p>“You ain’t goin’ no place, Pollock,” he said
shortly.</p>

<p>The crowd was moving forward now, coughing
from the powder fumes, wondering aloud what it
was all about. Sleepy jerked Amos to his feet.
The skid on the rough floor had removed some skin
from the bridge of Amos’s nose, and the shock of
the exposé seemed to have caved in his morale.</p>

<p>“I can talk, can’t I?” he panted anxiously.
“Can’t I tell what I know? I have that right,
sheriff. I—I know my rights. I’ll talk.”</p>

<p>No doubt Amos could see the outline of the
gallows, and he wanted to save his skin at the
expense of his confederates. Hashknife stilled the
hubbub.</p>

<p>“Let him talk, if he wants to, boys. He has a
right.”</p>

<p>“I know I have,” whined Amos.</p>

<p>Hashknife said a few short words to Len, who
stared at him in amazement, but went hurrying out
of the place. The sheriff moved the men back from
Amos, who was panting heavily.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and talk,” said Hashknife. “Nobody
stoppin’ yuh.”</p>

<p>Amos gulped and began:</p>

<p>“I never killed anybody. Honest to God, I
never killed anybody. Harry Cole pulled the jobs.
He was sheriff and I was the prosecutor. He wanted
money. Prentice was crooked. He wanted Len’s
wife. We needed some one to blame for the two
robberies, so we framed to incriminate Len. Prentice
stole that hat, and the bank robbery was a
fake, but we sent Len to the penitentiary. I swear
that’s the way of it. We didn’t think Len would
come back here. Prentice didn’t have any nerve,
and he worried. He thought somebody might find
out about it; so he drank. Cole was afraid he’d
talk, so he killed him. I didn’t know about it until
after it was all done. But I never hurt anybody.
I’m innocent of that. All I ever did was to protect
them and take my share.”</p>

<p>“Cole tried to kill me, eh?” grinned Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I know he did. Pollock helped him the last
time.”</p>

<p>“You dirty liar!” screamed Pollock.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got yore derringer,” said Hashknife.
“You left your callin’ card, Jack Evans. Yeah,
I think there’s still a reward for you in Redfields.”</p>

<p>“Cole was right,” gritted Pollock. “He had the
dope on you. I thought he was crazy. Well, damn
you, all you can do is send me back to Redfields.
I can square that all right.”</p>

<p>Some one had brought the doctor, who went to
work on Cole and the swamper. The sheriff walked
around in a daze, after putting handcuffs on Pollock.
He came to Hashknife.</p>

<p>“I said you was a pest,” he said seriously.
“Wasn’t that funny? I did, I tell yuh. Thought
you was a pest; you and yore questions. I have
to laugh.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Hashknife. “You can laugh,
if you feel thataway.”</p>

<p>Breezy had charge of Amos Baggs and seemed to
be getting a lot of joy out of his job. Harry Cole
wasn’t dead, and the doctor said he would probably
live, but Cole did not seem to have any opinions
in the matter.</p>

<p>Suddenly another hush. The roar of conversation
slowed down to dead silence. Len Ayres was coming
in, and beside him, looking very white and wide-eyed,
was Nan. Baggs looked at her, wet his dry
lips with his tongue and stared down at the
floor.</p>

<p>Len touched Amos on the arm and the lawyer
looked up at him.</p>

<p>“Do you want to tell this part of it?” he asked.
“Or shall I ask the lady to tell it? She don’t
know what it’s all about—yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Amos
huskily.</p>

<p>“Don’t lie about it,” warned Len. He turned
to Nan. “You tell it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” she said. “I don’t know what it was
all about.”</p>

<p>“Nan, don’t lie to me!” Len cried. “I knew
all the time that you wasn’t the rightful heir to
the Box S. I could block yuh any time I wanted
to, but I—I didn’t. Somethin’ held me back,
somethin’ that told me if I went slow I’d mebby
clear myself.”</p>

<p>“Yo’re as clear as a bell, Len,” said the sheriff.
“Baggs confessed the whole thing. Cole and
Prentice and Baggs pulled the job. You are cleared
of everythin’.”</p>

<p>Nan impulsively reached out and grasped Len
by the arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad!” she said. “Just so glad.”</p>

<p>“Are yuh? Then come clean on this deal, Nan.
I’ve got the goods on yuh, so yuh might as well
tell us.”</p>

<p>Nan looked around at the circle of faces, some
of them blurred by the eddying tobacco and powder
smoke. She looked at Hashknife, and his gray eyes
were watching her closely.</p>

<p>“I took a dead girl’s name,” she said slowly.
“She was my room-mate. We were both poor and
out of jobs. She was killed in a wreck, and Jack
Pollock was hurt at the same time.</p>

<p>“There was a letter to her from Amos Baggs,
telling her to come and claim her inheritance.
There was a hundred-dollar cheque in the letter.
Well, I took it and came here. I’m an impostor.
My name is Nan Whitlock—not Singer. Mr. Baggs
said he’d send me to prison. Pollock had told him
that I wasn’t the right girl. Baggs tried to get
me to sign papers out at the ranch. He said I
would be sent to jail if I didn’t sign them, but I—I
said I’d rather go to jail.</p>

<p>“They—Baggs and Pollock—brought me to town
that night and were going to send me to San
Francisco, but we were late getting here and Pollock
had lost his pocket-book, which contained the
tickets and his money. They said they would
protect me from the law until they could safely
ship me away; so they took me to a house and
kept me there, locked up. I—I didn’t know just
why they were afraid to send me away. Then
to-night I heard the shooting in the house, and—and
that is about all I know.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven!” said Len. “That’s good
news.” He turned savagely on the handcuffed
Baggs. “I’ve got the goods on you, Baggs. You
or some of yore gang murdered Harmony Singer.
I knew it, but I couldn’t prove it. I couldn’t prove
anythin’, but Hartley did. So you picked a girl
named Singer to inherit the ranch, eh? Goin’ to
buy her out and split the pot, eh? You fool! His
name wasn’t Singer. His name was Ayres. He was
my uncle, Baggs. But he was kinda wild in New
Mexico; so he changed his name when he came
here. His name was Jim Ayres. Here!” he handed
a folded paper to Hashknife. “Read it out loud,
Hashknife. That’ll explain.”</p>

<p>It was an old sheet of writing paper, slightly
yellowed, and the writing was in ink, slightly hard
to decipher. Hashknife read aloud:</p>

<p>“‘This is to certify that Len Ayres has paid me
the sum of ten thousand dollars⸺’”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” interrupted Len. “That ten
thousand is the money I inherited about six months
before this gang sent me to the penitentiary. Go
ahead, Hashknife.”</p>

<p>“‘Ten thousand dollars in cash, and I hereby
give him one-half of the Box S Ranch and everything
on it, and one-half of the money in the bank,
and of future profits. Len don’t want no deed, so
this is a bill of sale. And this is also to certify that
in case of my death, everything I own belongs to
Len Ayres, and he is to give Whispering Taylor
and Sailor Jones a home for life, or as long as he
can get along with them. Very truly yours, Jim
Harmony Singer Ayres. P.S.—This is my right
name, except the Singer part, which is an adopted
brand, and nobody’s business.’”</p>

<p>“The warden at the penitentiary kept that for
me,” said Len slowly. “I didn’t want a deed, and
I reckon most of yuh boys present know why. I
managed to save this much out of the wreck.”</p>

<p>“You knew?” said Nan, looking up at him.
“Was that why you said, Len, when I asked you
if you didn’t trust me, ‘I’ll tell yuh about it some
time’?”</p>

<p>Len looked at her closely, and there was a half
smile on his thin, drawn lips.</p>

<p>“I reckon it was, Nan. But this ain’t no place
to tell yuh about it. C’mon.”</p>

<p>They turned together and walked out of the
saloon. Breezy took Baggs and Pollock, and Sleepy
went with him. The doctor was working over Cole
in Cole’s own room, while the swamper was sitting
in a chair near the door, his head bandaged temporarily.
He had been the one who carried the
tray to the Prentice home.</p>

<p>The sheriff came to Hashknife, his eyes curious.</p>

<p>“What evidence did yuh have against them for
all that stuff, Hartley?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, Dillon; just a hunch.”</p>

<p>“You mean—you bluffed? How did yuh find
the girl?”</p>

<p>“Imagination,” smiled Hashknife. “I had their
tickets, and I knew they never left here. Where
could they go, I wondered. What better place than
the Prentice home, owned by Cole? They had to
be fed. I saw a Chinaman bring a tray here. That
would solve the problem. So we hid out there
to-night and watched a tray come in. When that
swamper took it to the Prentice house I had to
bat him over the head, and it almost ruined things.
But, as it was, it worked out right. Pollock was
fool enough to try and warn Cole. The stage was
all set when I came in, and they didn’t stop to
realise that I didn’t have evidence. I didn’t ask
questions, Dillon; I told ’em what they’d done—and
they knew it was true.”</p>

<p>“Golly, but yo’re lucky! I’d never ’a’ thought
of that.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m lucky. It’s shore hard work, buildin’
up luck.”</p>

<p>Hashknife turned and started to walk out. On
the bar rail sat Whispering and Sailor, dead to the
world. Whispering had an arm thrown around
Sailor’s shoulders and they were both snoring
lustily.</p>

<p>“You boys can go home again,” said Hashknife
softly, but they didn’t hear him.</p>

<p>He walked outside and crossed the street. In
front of the sheriff’s office he found Nan, Len, and
little Larry. Hashknife would have avoided them,
but it was impossible. Len held out his hand and
they gripped tightly.</p>

<p>“Dad never done nothin’ wrong,” said Larry.
“Ain’t it great?”</p>

<p>“Shore is great, Larry,” replied Hashknife.
“That fixes yuh up now.”</p>

<p>“And the mule stepped on the kite to-day, but
I can make another—if we ever git any wind.”</p>

<p>“Even the wind will come, if yuh wait long
enough, Larry.”</p>

<p>Hashknife noticed that Nan was crying, and that
Len put an arm around her.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you thank him, Len?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Honey, they never built enough words. I can’t
think what to say.”</p>

<p>“Thasall right,” said Hashknife. “Everythin’ is
all right.”</p>

<p>He walked past them to where Sleepy was coming
from the door of the sheriff’s office, and they slipped
away in the darkness together. They rode to the
rear of the hotel, where they secured their war
bags. Their rent was all paid up.</p>

<p>They tied the bags to their saddles and mounted.</p>

<p>“East of here,” said Sleepy softly, “there’s some
tall hills, and they say it’s twenty-five miles to the
nearest town in that direction. I dunno what else
is on that side of the hill.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look, pardner,” said Hashknife,
and they rode away in the darkness.</p>

<p>On the south road a little while later, while a
moon peeped over the rim of the Broken Hills,
sending its blue rays down across the Manzanita
range, travelled a slow-moving buckboard, loaded
to capacity.</p>

<p>Len and Nan were on the seat, with Larry wedged
between them, while in the back of the equipage,
fitted in like sardines in a can, rode Whispering
Taylor and Sailor Jones, both snoring heavily, at
peace with the world. They were all going back
home.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
